 The 'temperature' at which a launch sequence had started.

 The lower the temperature the more work has to be done during start-up.
 A 'cold' temperature means that a new process has been started and likely
 nothing is cached.

 A hot temperature means the existing activity is brought to the foreground.
 It may need to regenerate some objects as a result of {@code onTrimMemory}.

 A warm temperature is in the middle; an existing process is used, but the activity
 has to be created from scratch with {@code #onCreate}.
