</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 &lt;p&gt;The Area class is used for choosing specific metering and focus areas for
 the camera to use when calculating auto-exposure, auto-white balance, and
 auto-focus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To find out how many simultaneous areas a given camera supports, use
 {@link android.hardware.Camera.Parameters#getMaxNumMeteringAreas()} and
 {@link android.hardware.Camera.Parameters#getMaxNumFocusAreas()}. If metering or focusing area
 selection is unsupported, these methods will return 0.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Each Area consists of a rectangle specifying its bounds, and a weight
 that determines its importance. The bounds are relative to the camera's
 current field of view. The coordinates are mapped so that (-1000, -1000)
 is always the top-left corner of the current field of view, and (1000,
 1000) is always the bottom-right corner of the current field of
 view. Setting Areas with bounds outside that range is not allowed. Areas
 with zero or negative width or height are not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The weight must range from 1 to 1000, and represents a weight for
 every pixel in the area. This means that a large metering area with
 the same weight as a smaller area will have more effect in the
 metering result.  Metering areas can overlap and the driver
 will add the weights in the overlap region.&lt;/p&gt;

 @deprecated We recommend using the new {@link android.hardware.camera2} API for new
             applications.
