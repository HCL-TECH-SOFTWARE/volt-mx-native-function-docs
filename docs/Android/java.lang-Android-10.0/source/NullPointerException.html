</span>@extends java.lang.RuntimeException

 Thrown when an application attempts to use {@code null} in a
 case where an object is required. These include:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Calling the instance method of a {@code null} object.
 &lt;li&gt;Accessing or modifying the field of a {@code null} object.
 &lt;li&gt;Taking the length of {@code null} as if it were an array.
 &lt;li&gt;Accessing or modifying the slots of {@code null} as if it
     were an array.
 &lt;li&gt;Throwing {@code null} as if it were a {@code Throwable}
     value.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 Applications should throw instances of this class to indicate
 other illegal uses of the {@code null} object.

 {@code NullPointerException} objects may be constructed by the
 virtual machine as if {@linkplain Throwable#Throwable(String,
 Throwable, boolean, boolean) suppression were disabled and/or the
 stack trace was not writable}.
