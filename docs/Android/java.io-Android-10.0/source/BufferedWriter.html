 Writes text to a character-output stream, buffering characters so as to
 provide for the efficient writing of single characters, arrays, and strings.

 &lt;p&gt; The buffer size may be specified, or the default size may be accepted.
 The default is large enough for most purposes.

 &lt;p&gt; A newLine() method is provided, which uses the platform's own notion of
 line separator as defined by the system property &lt;tt&gt;line.separator&lt;/tt&gt;.
 Not all platforms use the newline character ('\n') to terminate lines.
 Calling this method to terminate each output line is therefore preferred to
 writing a newline character directly.

 &lt;p&gt; In general, a Writer sends its output immediately to the underlying
 character or byte stream.  Unless prompt output is required, it is advisable
 to wrap a BufferedWriter around any Writer whose write() operations may be
 costly, such as FileWriters and OutputStreamWriters.  For example,

 &lt;pre&gt;
 PrintWriter out
   = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;foo.out&quot;)));
 &lt;/pre&gt;

 will buffer the PrintWriter's output to the file.  Without buffering, each
 invocation of a print() method would cause characters to be converted into
 bytes that would then be written immediately to the file, which can be very
 inefficient.

 &lt;p&gt; Ordinarily this method stores characters from the given array into
 this stream's buffer, flushing the buffer to the underlying stream as
 needed.  If the requested length is at least as large as the buffer,
 however, then this method will flush the buffer and write the characters
 directly to the underlying stream.  Thus redundant
 &lt;code&gt;BufferedWriter&lt;/code&gt;s will not copy data unnecessarily.

 &lt;p&gt; If the value of the &lt;tt&gt;len&lt;/tt&gt; parameter is negative then no
 characters are written.  This is contrary to the specification of this
 method in the {@linkplain java.io.Writer#write(java.lang.String,int,int)
 superclass}, which requires that an {@link IndexOutOfBoundsException} be
 thrown.
