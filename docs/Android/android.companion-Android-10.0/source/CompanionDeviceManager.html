 &lt;p&gt;Once at least one appropriate device is found, {@code callback} will be called with a
 {@link PendingIntent} that can be used to show the list of available devices for the user
 to select.
 It should be started for result (i.e. using
 {@link android.app.Activity#startIntentSenderForResult}), as the resulting
 {@link android.content.Intent} will contain extra {@link #EXTRA_DEVICE}, with the selected
 device. (e.g. {@link android.bluetooth.BluetoothDevice})&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If your app needs to be excluded from battery optimizations (run in the background)
 or to have unrestricted data access (use data in the background) you can declare that
 you use the {@link android.Manifest.permission#REQUEST_COMPANION_RUN_IN_BACKGROUND} and {@link android.Manifest.permission#REQUEST_COMPANION_USE_DATA_IN_BACKGROUND} respectively. Note that these
 special capabilities have a negative effect on the device's battery and user's data
 usage, therefore you should requested them when absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;You can call {@link #getAssociations} to get the list of currently associated
 devices, and {@link #disassociate} to remove an association. Consider doing so when the
 association is no longer relevant to avoid unnecessary battery and/or data drain resulting
 from special privileges that the association provides&lt;/p&gt;
