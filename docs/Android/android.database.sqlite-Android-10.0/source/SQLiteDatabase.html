</span>@extends android.database.sqlite.SQLiteClosable

 Exposes methods to manage a SQLite database.

 &lt;p&gt;
 SQLiteDatabase has methods to create, delete, execute SQL commands, and
 perform other common database management tasks.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 See the Notepad sample application in the SDK for an example of creating
 and managing a database.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 Database names must be unique within an application, not across all applications.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3&gt;Localized Collation - ORDER BY&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 In addition to SQLite's default &lt;code&gt;BINARY&lt;/code&gt; collator, Android supplies
 two more, &lt;code&gt;LOCALIZED&lt;/code&gt;, which changes with the system's current locale,
 and &lt;code&gt;UNICODE&lt;/code&gt;, which is the Unicode Collation Algorithm and not tailored
 to the current locale.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 it does not invoke delete triggers on those rows.

 the length of the LIKE or GLOB pattern is limited to SQLITE_MAX_LIKE_PATTERN_LENGTH bytes.

 even a pathological LIKE or GLOB pattern of 50000 bytes relatively quickly.
 The denial of service problem only comes into play when the pattern length gets

 want to reduce this parameter to something in the range of a few hundred

</span> &lt;p&gt;
 By default, foreign key constraints are not enforced by the database.
 This method allows an application to enable foreign key constraints.
 It must be called each time the database is opened to ensure that foreign
 key constraints are enabled for the session.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 A good time to call this method is right after calling {@link #openOrCreateDatabase}
 or in the {@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper#onConfigure} callback.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 When foreign key constraints are disabled, the database does not check whether
 changes to the database will violate foreign key constraints.  Likewise, when
 foreign key constraints are disabled, the database will not execute cascade
 delete or update triggers.  As a result, it is possible for the database
 state to become inconsistent.  To perform a database integrity check,
 call {@link #isDatabaseIntegrityOk}.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 This method must not be called while a transaction is in progress.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 See also &lt;a href=&quot;http://sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html&quot;&gt;SQLite Foreign Key Constraints&lt;/a&gt;
 for more details about foreign key constraint support.

<span id='android-database-sqlite-SQLiteDatabase-method-enableWriteAheadLogging'>/**This method enables parallel execution of queries from multiple threads on the
</span> same database.  It does this by opening multiple connections to the database
 and using a different database connection for each query.  The database
 journal mode is also changed to enable writes to proceed concurrently with reads.
 &lt;p&gt;
 When write-ahead logging is not enabled (the default), it is not possible for
 reads and writes to occur on the database at the same time.  Before modifying the
 database, the writer implicitly acquires an exclusive lock on the database which
 prevents readers from accessing the database until the write is completed.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 In contrast, when write-ahead logging is enabled (by calling this method), write
 operations occur in a separate log file which allows reads to proceed concurrently.
 While a write is in progress, readers on other threads will perceive the state
 of the database as it was before the write began.  When the write completes, readers
 on other threads will then perceive the new state of the database.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 It is a good idea to enable write-ahead logging whenever a database will be
 concurrently accessed and modified by multiple threads at the same time.
 However, write-ahead logging uses significantly more memory than ordinary
 journaling because there are multiple connections to the same database.
 So if a database will only be used by a single thread, or if optimizing
 concurrency is not very important, then write-ahead logging should be disabled.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 After calling this method, execution of queries in parallel is enabled as long as
 the database remains open.  To disable execution of queries in parallel, either
 call {@link #disableWriteAheadLogging} or close the database and reopen it.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 The maximum number of connections used to execute queries in parallel is
 dependent upon the device memory and possibly other properties.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 If a query is part of a transaction, then it is executed on the same database handle the
 transaction was begun.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 Writers should use {@link #beginTransactionNonExclusive}() or
 {@link #beginTransactionWithListenerNonExclusive}(SQLiteTransactionListener)
 to start a transaction.  Non-exclusive mode allows database file to be in readable
 by other threads executing queries.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 If the database has any attached databases, then execution of queries in parallel is NOT
 possible.  Likewise, write-ahead logging is not supported for read-only databases
 or memory databases.  In such cases, {@link #enableWriteAheadLogging} returns false.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 The best way to enable write-ahead logging is to pass the
 {@link #ENABLE_WRITE_AHEAD_LOGGING} flag to {@link #openDatabase}.  This is
 more efficient than calling {@link #enableWriteAheadLogging}.
 &lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
     SQLiteDatabase db = SQLiteDatabase.openDatabase(&quot;db_filename&quot;, cursorFactory,
             SQLiteDatabase.CREATE_IF_NECESSARY | SQLiteDatabase.ENABLE_WRITE_AHEAD_LOGGING,
             myDatabaseErrorHandler);
 &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 Another way to enable write-ahead logging is to call {@link #enableWriteAheadLogging}
 after opening the database.
 &lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
     SQLiteDatabase db = SQLiteDatabase.openDatabase(&quot;db_filename&quot;, cursorFactory,
             SQLiteDatabase.CREATE_IF_NECESSARY, myDatabaseErrorHandler);
     db.enableWriteAheadLogging();
 &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
