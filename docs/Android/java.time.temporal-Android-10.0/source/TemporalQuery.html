</span> Strategy for querying a temporal object.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Queries are a key tool for extracting information from temporal objects.
 They exist to externalize the process of querying, permitting different
 approaches, as per the strategy design pattern.
 Examples might be a query that checks if the date is the day before February 29th
 in a leap year, or calculates the number of days to your next birthday.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalField} interface provides another mechanism for querying
 temporal objects. That interface is limited to returning a {@code long}.
 By contrast, queries can return any type.
 &lt;p&gt;
 There are two equivalent ways of using a {@code TemporalQuery}.
 The first is to invoke the method on this interface directly.
 The second is to use {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalAccessor#query(TemporalQuery)}:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
   temporal = thisQuery.queryFrom(temporal);
   temporal = temporal.query(thisQuery);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 It is recommended to use the second approach, {@code query(TemporalQuery)},
 as it is a lot clearer to read in code.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The most common implementations are method references, such as
 {@code LocalDate::from} and {@code ZoneId::from}.
 Additional common queries are provided as static methods in {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalQueries}.

 @implSpec
 This interface places no restrictions on the mutability of implementations,
 however immutability is strongly recommended.

 @param &lt;R&gt; the type returned from the query

var TemporalQuery = {

<span id='java-time-temporal-TemporalQuery-method-queryFrom'>/**Queries the specified temporal object.
</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This queries the specified temporal object to return an object using the logic
 encapsulated in the implementing class.
 Examples might be a query that checks if the date is the day before February 29th
 in a leap year, or calculates the number of days to your next birthday.
 &lt;p&gt;
 There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
 The first is to invoke this method directly.
 The second is to use {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalAccessor#query(TemporalQuery)}:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
   temporal = thisQuery.queryFrom(temporal);
   temporal = temporal.query(thisQuery);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 It is recommended to use the second approach, {@code query(TemporalQuery)},
 as it is a lot clearer to read in code.
@param {Object {TemporalAccessor}} temporal  the temporal object to query, not null
@param temporal  the temporal object to query, not null
@return {Object {java.lang.Object}} the queried value, may return null to indicate not found
@throws DateTimeException if unable to query
@throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
