</span> A unit of date-time, such as Days or Hours.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Measurement of time is built on units, such as years, months, days, hours, minutes and seconds.
 Implementations of this interface represent those units.
 &lt;p&gt;
 An instance of this interface represents the unit itself, rather than an amount of the unit.
 See {@link Period} for a class that represents an amount in terms of the common units.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The most commonly used units are defined in {@link java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit}.
 Further units are supplied in {@link java.time.temporal.IsoFields}.
 Units can also be written by application code by implementing this interface.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The unit works using double dispatch. Client code calls methods on a date-time like
 {@code LocalDateTime} which check if the unit is a {@code ChronoUnit}.
 If it is, then the date-time must handle it.
 Otherwise, the method call is re-dispatched to the matching method in this interface.

 @implSpec
 This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
 All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 It is recommended to use an enum where possible.

 @since 1.8

<span id='java-time-temporal-TemporalUnit-method-getDuration'>/**Gets the duration of this unit, which may be an estimate.
</span> &lt;p&gt;
 All units return a duration measured in standard nanoseconds from this method.
 The duration will be positive and non-zero.
 For example, an hour has a duration of {@code 60 * 60 * 1,000,000,000ns}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Some units may return an accurate duration while others return an estimate.
 For example, days have an estimated duration due to the possibility of
 daylight saving time changes.
 To determine if the duration is an estimate, use {@link #isDurationEstimated}().
@return {Object {java.time.Duration}} the duration of this unit, which may be an estimate, not null

 For example, days have an estimated duration due to the possibility of
 daylight saving time changes.
 This method returns true if the duration is an estimate and false if it is
 accurate. Note that accurate/estimated ignores leap seconds.

 This can be used to avoid throwing an exception.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This default implementation derives the value using
 {@link Temporal#plus(long, java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit)}.
@param {Object {Temporal}} temporal  the temporal object to check, not null

isSupportedBy : function(  ) {},

<span id='java-time-temporal-TemporalUnit-method-addTo'>/**Returns a copy of the specified temporal object with the specified period added.
</span> &lt;p&gt;
 The period added is a multiple of this unit. For example, this method
 could be used to add &quot;3 days&quot; to a date by calling this method on the
 instance representing &quot;days&quot;, passing the date and the period &quot;3&quot;.
 The period to be added may be negative, which is equivalent to subtraction.
 &lt;p&gt;
 There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
 The first is to invoke this method directly.
 The second is to use {@link Temporal#plus(long, java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit)}:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
   temporal = thisUnit.addTo(temporal);
   temporal = temporal.plus(thisUnit);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 It is recommended to use the second approach, {@code plus(TemporalUnit)},
 as it is a lot clearer to read in code.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Implementations should perform any queries or calculations using the units
 available in {@link java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit} or the fields available in {@link java.time.temporal.ChronoField}.
 If the unit is not supported an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException} must be thrown.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Implementations must not alter the specified temporal object.
 Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
 This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.
@param {Object {Temporal}} temporal  the temporal object to adjust, not null
@param {Number} amount  the amount of this unit to add, positive or negative
@param amount  the amount of this unit to add, positive or negative
@return {Object {java.time.temporal.Temporal}} the adjusted temporal object, not null
@throws DateTimeException if the amount cannot be added
@throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the unit is not supported by the temporal
*/
addTo : function(  ) {},

<span id='java-time-temporal-TemporalUnit-method-between'>/**Calculates the amount of time between two temporal objects.
</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This calculates the amount in terms of this unit. The start and end
 points are supplied as temporal objects and must be of compatible types.
 The implementation will convert the second type to be an instance of the
 first type before the calculating the amount.
 The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
 For example, the amount in hours between two temporal objects can be
 calculated using {@code HOURS.between(startTime, endTime)}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
 complete units between the two temporals.
 For example, the amount in hours between the times 11:30 and 13:29
 will only be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.
 &lt;p&gt;
 There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
 The first is to invoke this method directly.
 The second is to use {@link Temporal#until(Temporal, java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit)}:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   // these two lines are equivalent
   between = thisUnit.between(start, end);
   between = start.until(end, thisUnit);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For example, this method allows the number of days between two dates to
 be calculated:
 &lt;pre&gt;
  long daysBetween = DAYS.between(start, end);
  // or alternatively
  long daysBetween = start.until(end, DAYS);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 Implementations should perform any queries or calculations using the units
 available in {@link java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit} or the fields available in {@link java.time.temporal.ChronoField}.
 If the unit is not supported an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException} must be thrown.
 Implementations must not alter the specified temporal objects.
@param {Object {Temporal}} temporal1Inclusive  the base temporal object, not null
@param {Object {Temporal}} temporal2Exclusive  the other temporal object, exclusive, not null
@param temporal2Exclusive  the other temporal object, exclusive, not null
@return {Number} the amount of time between temporal1Inclusive and temporal2Exclusive
  in terms of this unit; positive if temporal2Exclusive is later than
  temporal1Inclusive, negative if earlier
@throws DateTimeException if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
  temporal cannot be converted to the same type as the start temporal
@throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the unit is not supported by the temporal
@throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
