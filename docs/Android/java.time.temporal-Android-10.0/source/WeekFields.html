</span> implements java.io.Serializable

@extends java.lang.Object

 Localized definitions of the day-of-week, week-of-month and week-of-year fields.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A standard week is seven days long, but cultures have different definitions for some
 other aspects of a week. This class represents the definition of the week, for the
 purpose of providing {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalField} instances.
 &lt;p&gt;
 WeekFields provides five fields,
 {@link #dayOfWeek}(), {@link #weekOfMonth}(), {@link #weekOfYear}(),
 {@link #weekOfWeekBasedYear}(), and {@link #weekBasedYear}()
 that provide access to the values from any {@linkplain java.time.temporal.Temporal temporal object}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The computations for day-of-week, week-of-month, and week-of-year are based
 on the  {@linkplain java.time.temporal.ChronoField#YEAR proleptic-year},
 {@linkplain java.time.temporal.ChronoField#MONTH_OF_YEAR month-of-year},
 {@linkplain java.time.temporal.ChronoField#DAY_OF_MONTH day-of-month}, and
 {@linkplain java.time.temporal.ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK ISO day-of-week} which are based on the
 {@linkplain java.time.temporal.ChronoField#EPOCH_DAY epoch-day} and the chronology.
 The values may not be aligned with the {@linkplain java.time.temporal.ChronoField#YEAR_OF_ERA year-of-Era}
 depending on the Chronology.
 &lt;p&gt;A week is defined by:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The first day-of-week.
 For example, the ISO-8601 standard considers Monday to be the first day-of-week.
 &lt;li&gt;The minimal number of days in the first week.
 For example, the ISO-8601 standard counts the first week as needing at least 4 days.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 Together these two values allow a year or month to be divided into weeks.

 &lt;h3&gt;Week of Month&lt;/h3&gt;
 One field is used: week-of-month.
 The calculation ensures that weeks never overlap a month boundary.
 The month is divided into periods where each period starts on the defined first day-of-week.
 The earliest period is referred to as week 0 if it has less than the minimal number of days
 and week 1 if it has at least the minimal number of days.

 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2009-01-01&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Thursday&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Week 1 of January 2009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Week 0 of January 2009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2009-01-04&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sunday&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Week 1 of January 2009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Week 0 of January 2009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2009-01-05&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Monday&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Week 2 of January 2009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Week 1 of January 2009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;

 &lt;h3&gt;Week of Year&lt;/h3&gt;
 One field is used: week-of-year.
 The calculation ensures that weeks never overlap a year boundary.
 The year is divided into periods where each period starts on the defined first day-of-week.
 The earliest period is referred to as week 0 if it has less than the minimal number of days
 and week 1 if it has at least the minimal number of days.

 &lt;h3&gt;Week Based Year&lt;/h3&gt;
 Two fields are used for week-based-year, one for the
 {@link #weekOfWeekBasedYear() week-of-week-based-year} and one for
 {@link #weekBasedYear() week-based-year}.  In a week-based-year, each week
 belongs to only a single year.  Week 1 of a year is the first week that
 starts on the first day-of-week and has at least the minimum number of days.
 The first and last weeks of a year may contain days from the
 previous calendar year or next calendar year respectively.

  &lt;td&gt;Week 1 of 2009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Week 53 of 2008&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2009-01-01&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Thursday&lt;/td&gt;
