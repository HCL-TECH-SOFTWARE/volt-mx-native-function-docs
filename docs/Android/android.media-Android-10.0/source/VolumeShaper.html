@extends java.lang.Object

 The {@code VolumeShaper} class is used to automatically control audio volume during media
 playback, allowing simple implementation of transition effects and ducking.
 It is created from implementations of {@code VolumeAutomation},
 such as {@code MediaPlayer} and {@code AudioTrack} (referred to as &quot;players&quot; below),
 by {@link android.media.MediaPlayer#createVolumeShaper} or {@link android.media.AudioTrack#createVolumeShaper}.

 A {@code VolumeShaper} is intended for short volume changes.
 If the audio output sink changes during
 a {@code VolumeShaper} transition, the precise curve position may be lost, and the
 {@code VolumeShaper} may advance to the end of the curve for the new audio output sink.

 The {@code VolumeShaper} appears as an additional scaling on the audio output,
 and adjusts independently of track or stream volume controls.
