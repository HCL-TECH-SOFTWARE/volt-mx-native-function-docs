</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 A class to encapsulate information about an audio focus request.
 An {@code AudioFocusRequest} instance is built by {@link android.media.AudioAttributes.Builder}, and is used to
 request and abandon audio focus, respectively
 with {@link android.media.AudioManager#requestAudioFocus(AudioFocusRequest)} and
 {@link android.media.AudioManager#abandonAudioFocusRequest(AudioFocusRequest)}.

 &lt;h3&gt;What is audio focus?&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Audio focus is a concept introduced in API 8. It is used to convey the fact that a user can
 only focus on a single audio stream at a time, e.g. listening to music or a podcast, but not
 both at the same time. In some cases, multiple audio streams can be playing at the same time,
 but there is only one the user would really listen to (focus on), while the other plays in
 the background. An example of this is driving directions being spoken while music plays at
 a reduced volume (a.k.a. ducking).
 &lt;p&gt;When an application requests audio focus, it expresses its intention to “own” audio focus to
 play audio. Let’s review the different types of focus requests, the return value after a request,
 and the responses to a loss.
 &lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Note: applications should not play anything until granted focus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3&gt;The different types of focus requests&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;There are four focus request types. A successful focus request with each will yield different
 behaviors by the system and the other application that previously held audio focus.
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@link android.media.AudioManager#AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN} expresses the fact that your application is now the
 sole source of audio that the user is listening to. The duration of the audio playback is
 unknown, and is possibly very long: after the user finishes interacting with your application,
 (s)he doesn’t expect another audio stream to resume. Examples of uses of this focus gain are
 for music playback, for a game or a video player.&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;{@link android.media.AudioManager#AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT} is for a situation when you know your
 application is temporarily grabbing focus from the current owner, but the user expects playback
 to go back to where it was once your application no longer requires audio focus. An example is
 for playing an alarm, or during a VoIP call. The playback is known to be finite: the alarm will
 time-out or be dismissed, the VoIP call has a beginning and an end. When any of those events
 ends, and if the user was listening to music when it started, the user expects music to resume,
 but didn’t wish to listen to both at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;{@link android.media.AudioManager#AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT_MAY_DUCK}: this focus request type is similar
 to {@code AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT} for the temporary aspect of the focus request, but it also
 expresses the fact during the time you own focus, you allow another application to keep playing
 at a reduced volume, “ducked”. Examples are when playing driving directions or notifications,
 it’s ok for music to keep playing, but not loud enough that it would prevent the directions to
 be hard to understand. A typical attenuation by the “ducked” application is a factor of 0.2f
 (or -14dB), that can for instance be applied with {@code MediaPlayer.setVolume(0.2f)} when
 using this class for playback.&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;{@link android.media.AudioManager#AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT_EXCLUSIVE} is also for a temporary request,
 but also expresses that your application expects the device to not play anything else. This is
 typically used if you are doing audio recording or speech recognition, and don’t want for
 examples notifications to be played by the system during that time.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;An {@code AudioFocusRequest} instance always contains one of the four types of requests
 explained above. It is passed when building an {@code AudioFocusRequest} instance with its
 builder in the {@link android.media.AudioAttributes.Builder} constructor
 {@link android.media.AudioFocusRequest.Builder#android.media.AudioFocusRequest.Builder(int)}, or
 with {@link android.media.AudioFocusRequest.Builder#setFocusGain(int)} after copying an existing instance with
 {@link android.media.AudioFocusRequest.Builder#android.media.AudioFocusRequest.Builder(android.media.AudioFocusRequest)}.

 &lt;h3&gt;Qualifying your focus request&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;h4&gt;Use case requiring a focus request&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Any focus request is qualified by the {@link android.media.AudioAttributes}
 (see {@link android.media.AudioAttributes.Builder#setAudioAttributes(AudioAttributes)}) that describe the audio use case that
 will follow the request (once it's successful or granted). It is recommended to use the
 same {@code AudioAttributes} for the request as the attributes you are using for audio/media
 playback.
 &lt;br&gt;If no attributes are set, default attributes of {@link android.media.AudioAttributes#USAGE_MEDIA} are used.

 &lt;h4&gt;Delayed focus&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Audio focus can be &quot;locked&quot; by the system for a number of reasons: during a phone call, when
 the car to which the device is connected plays an emergency message... To support these
 situations, the application can request to be notified when its request is fulfilled, by flagging
 its request as accepting delayed focus, with {@link android.media.AudioAttributes.Builder#setAcceptsDelayedFocusGain(boolean)}.
 &lt;br&gt;If focus is requested while being locked by the system,
 {@link android.media.AudioManager#requestAudioFocus(AudioFocusRequest)} will return
 {@link android.media.AudioManager#AUDIOFOCUS_REQUEST_DELAYED}. When focus isn't locked anymore, the focus
 listener set with {@link android.media.AudioAttributes.Builder#setOnAudioFocusChangeListener(OnAudioFocusChangeListener)}
 or with {@link android.media.AudioAttributes.Builder#setOnAudioFocusChangeListener(OnAudioFocusChangeListener, Handler)} will
 be called to notify the application it now owns audio focus.

 &lt;h4&gt;Pausing vs ducking&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;When an application requested audio focus with
 {@link android.media.AudioManager#AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT_MAY_DUCK}, the system will duck the current focus
 owner.
 &lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Note: this behavior is &lt;b&gt;new for Android O&lt;/b&gt;, whereas applications targeting
 SDK level up to API 25 had to implement the ducking themselves when they received a focus
 loss of {@link android.media.AudioManager#AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT_CAN_DUCK}.
 &lt;p&gt;But ducking is not always the behavior expected by the user. A typical example is when the
 device plays driving directions while the user is listening to an audio book or podcast, and
 expects the audio playback to pause, instead of duck, as it is hard to understand a navigation
 prompt and spoken content at the same time. Therefore the system will not automatically duck
 when it detects it would be ducking spoken content: such content is detected when the
 {@code AudioAttributes} of the player are qualified by
 {@link android.media.AudioAttributes#CONTENT_TYPE_SPEECH}. Refer for instance to
 {@link android.media.AudioAttributes.Builder#setContentType(int)} and
 {@link android.media.MediaPlayer#setAudioAttributes(AudioAttributes)} if you are writing a media playback
 application for audio book, podcasts... Since the system will not automatically duck applications
 that play speech, it calls their focus listener instead to notify them of
 {@link android.media.AudioManager#AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT_CAN_DUCK}, so they can pause instead. Note that
 this behavior is independent of the use of {@code AudioFocusRequest}, but tied to the use
 of {@code AudioAttributes}.
 &lt;p&gt;If your application requires pausing instead of ducking for any other reason than playing
 speech, you can also declare so with {@link android.media.AudioAttributes.Builder#setWillPauseWhenDucked(boolean)}, which will
 cause the system to call your focus listener instead of automatically ducking.

 &lt;h4&gt;Example&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The example below covers the following steps to be found in any application that would play
 audio, and use audio focus. Here we play an audio book, and our application is intended to pause
 rather than duck when it loses focus. These steps consist in:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Creating {@code AudioAttributes} to be used for the playback and the focus request.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Configuring and creating the {@code AudioFocusRequest} instance that defines the intended
     focus behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Requesting audio focus and checking the return code to see if playback can happen right
     away, or is delayed.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Implementing a focus change listener to respond to focus gains and losses.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
