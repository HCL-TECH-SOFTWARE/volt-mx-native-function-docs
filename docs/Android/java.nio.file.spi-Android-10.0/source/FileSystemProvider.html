</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Service-provider class for file systems. The methods defined by the {@link java.nio.file.Files} class will typically delegate to an instance of this
 class.

 &lt;p&gt; A file system provider is a concrete implementation of this class that
 implements the abstract methods defined by this class. A provider is
 identified by a {@code URI} {@link #getScheme() scheme}. The default provider
 is identified by the URI scheme &quot;file&quot;. It creates the {@link FileSystem} that
 provides access to the file systems accessible to the Java virtual machine.
 The {@link FileSystems} class defines how file system providers are located
 and loaded. The default provider is typically a system-default provider but
 may be overridden if the system property {@code
 java.nio.file.spi.DefaultFileSystemProvider} is set. In that case, the
 provider has a one argument constructor whose formal parameter type is {@code
 FileSystemProvider}. All other providers have a zero argument constructor
 that initializes the provider.

 &lt;p&gt; A provider is a factory for one or more {@link FileSystem} instances. Each
 file system is identified by a {@code URI} where the URI's scheme matches
 the provider's {@link #getScheme scheme}. The default file system, for example,
 is identified by the URI {@code &quot;file:///&quot;}. A memory-based file system,
 for example, may be identified by a URI such as {@code &quot;memory:///?name=logfs&quot;}.
 The {@link #newFileSystem newFileSystem} method may be used to create a file
 system, and the {@link #getFileSystem getFileSystem} method may be used to
 obtain a reference to an existing file system created by the provider. Where
 a provider is the factory for a single file system then it is provider dependent
 if the file system is created when the provider is initialized, or later when
 the {@code newFileSystem} method is invoked. In the case of the default
 provider, the {@code FileSystem} is created when the provider is initialized.

 &lt;p&gt; All of the methods in this class are safe for use by multiple concurrent
 threads.

 &lt;p&gt; This method may be used by the {@link Files#isReadable isReadable},
 {@link Files#isWritable isWritable} and {@link Files#isExecutable
 isExecutable} methods to check the accessibility of a file.

 &lt;p&gt; This method checks the existence of a file and that this Java virtual
 machine has appropriate privileges that would allow it access the file
 according to all of access modes specified in the {@code modes} parameter
 as follows:

 &lt;table border=1 cellpadding=5 summary=&quot;&quot;&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

   &lt;td&gt; {@link AccessMode#READ READ} &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt; Checks that the file exists and that the Java virtual machine has

 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt; {@link AccessMode#WRITE WRITE} &lt;/td&gt;

 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt; {@link AccessMode#EXECUTE EXECUTE} &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt; Checks that the file exists and that the Java virtual machine has
     permission to {@link Runtime#exec execute} the file. The semantics
     may differ when checking access to a directory. For example, on UNIX
     systems, checking for {@code EXECUTE} access checks that the Java
     virtual machine has permission to search the directory in order to
     access file or subdirectories. &lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;

 of the file is checked.

 object is a symbolic link. Depending on the implementation, this method
 may require to read file permissions, access control lists, or other
 file attributes in order to check the effective access to the file. To
 determine the effective access to a file may require access to several
 attributes and so in some implementations this method may not be atomic
 with respect to other file system operations.
@param {Object {Path}} path
          the path to the file to check
@param {Object {java.nio.file.AccessMode[]}} modes

@throws UnsupportedOperationException

          {@code READ}, {@code WRITE}, and {@code EXECUTE} access. This
          exception is specified to allow for the {@code Access} enum to
          be extended in future releases.
