 Waveform vibrations are a potentially repeating series of timing and amplitude pairs. For

 vibration (i.e. off), and any pairs with a timing value of 0 will be ignored.

 The amplitude array of the generated waveform will be the same size as the given
 timing array with alternating values of 0 (i.e. off) and {@link #DEFAULT_AMPLITUDE},

 the vibrator on, the second value will be how long to vibrate at {@link #DEFAULT_AMPLITUDE}
 strength, etc.

 To cause the pattern to repeat, pass the index into the timings array at which to start the
 repetition, or -1 to disable repeating.
