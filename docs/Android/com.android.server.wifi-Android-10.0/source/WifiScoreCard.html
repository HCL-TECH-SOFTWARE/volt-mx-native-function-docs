 Normally this happens just once, shortly after we start. But wifi can
 come up before the disk is ready, and we might not yet have a valid wall
 clock when we start up, so we need to be prepared to begin recording data
 even if the MemoryStore is not yet available.

 When the store is installed for the first time, we want to merge any
 recently recorded data together with data already in the store. But if
 the store restarts and has to be reinstalled, we don't want to do
 this merge, because that would risk double-counting the old data.
