 A &lt;code&gt;LayoutManager&lt;/code&gt; is responsible for measuring and positioning item views
 within a &lt;code&gt;RecyclerView&lt;/code&gt; as well as determining the policy for when to recycle
 item views that are no longer visible to the user. By changing the &lt;code&gt;LayoutManager&lt;/code&gt;
 a &lt;code&gt;RecyclerView&lt;/code&gt; can be used to implement a standard vertically scrolling list,
 a uniform grid, staggered grids, horizontally scrolling collections and more. Several stock
 layout managers are provided for general use.
 &lt;p/&gt;
 If the LayoutManager specifies a default constructor or one with the signature
 ({@link Context}, {@link AttributeSet}, {@code int}, {@code int}), RecyclerView will
 instantiate and set the LayoutManager when being inflated. Most used properties can
 be then obtained from {@link #getProperties(Context, AttributeSet, int, int)}. In case
 a LayoutManager specifies both constructors, the non-default constructor will take
 precedence.

<span id='com-android-internal-widget-RecyclerView-LayoutManager-method-setAutoMeasureEnabled'>/**Defines whether the layout should be measured by the RecyclerView or the LayoutManager
</span> wants to handle the layout measurements itself.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This method is usually called by the LayoutManager with value {@code true} if it wants
 to support WRAP_CONTENT. If you are using a public LayoutManager but want to customize
 the measurement logic, you can call this method with {@code false} and override
 {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.LayoutManager#onMeasure(int, int)} to implement your custom measurement logic.
 &lt;p&gt;
 AutoMeasure is a convenience mechanism for LayoutManagers to easily wrap their content or
 handle various specs provided by the RecyclerView's parent.
 It works by calling {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.LayoutManager#onLayoutChildren(Recycler, State)} during an
 {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView#onMeasure(int, int)} call, then calculating desired dimensions based
 on children's positions. It does this while supporting all existing animation
 capabilities of the RecyclerView.
 &lt;p&gt;
 AutoMeasure works as follows:
 &lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;LayoutManager should call {@code setAutoMeasureEnabled(true)} to enable it. All of
 the framework LayoutManagers use {@code auto-measure}.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;When {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView#onMeasure(int, int)} is called, if the provided specs are
 exact, RecyclerView will only call LayoutManager's {@code onMeasure} and return without
 doing any layout calculation.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If one of the layout specs is not {@code EXACT}, the RecyclerView will start the
 layout process in {@code onMeasure} call. It will process all pending Adapter updates and
 decide whether to run a predictive layout or not. If it decides to do so, it will first
 call {@link #onLayoutChildren(Recycler, com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.State)} with {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.State#isPreLayout()} set to
 {@code true}. At this stage, {@link #getWidth}() and {@link #getHeight}() will still
 return the width and height of the RecyclerView as of the last layout calculation.
 &lt;p&gt;
 After handling the predictive case, RecyclerView will call
 {@link #onLayoutChildren(Recycler, com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.State)} with {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.State#isMeasuring()} set to
 {@code true} and {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.State#isPreLayout()} set to {@code false}. The LayoutManager can
 access the measurement specs via {@link #getHeight}(), {@link #getHeightMode}(),
 {@link #getWidth}() and {@link #getWidthMode}().&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;After the layout calculation, RecyclerView sets the measured width &amp; height by
 calculating the bounding box for the children (+ RecyclerView's padding). The
 LayoutManagers can override {@link #setMeasuredDimension(Rect, int, int)} to choose
 different values. For instance, GridLayoutManager overrides this value to handle the case
 where if it is vertical and has 3 columns but only 2 items, it should still measure its
 width to fit 3 items, not 2.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Any following on measure call to the RecyclerView will run
 {@link #onLayoutChildren(Recycler, com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.State)} with {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.State#isMeasuring()} set to
 {@code true} and {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.State#isPreLayout()} set to {@code false}. RecyclerView will
 take care of which views are actually added / removed / moved / changed for animations so
 that the LayoutManager should not worry about them and handle each
 {@link #onLayoutChildren(Recycler, com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.State)} call as if it is the last one.
 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;When measure is complete and RecyclerView's
 {@link #onLayout(boolean, int, int, int, int)} method is called, RecyclerView checks
 whether it already did layout calculations during the measure pass and if so, it re-uses
 that information. It may still decide to call {@link #onLayoutChildren(Recycler, com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.State)}
 if the last measure spec was different from the final dimensions or adapter contents
 have changed between the measure call and the layout call.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Finally, animations are calculated and run as usual.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;

 The LayoutManager is in charge of the behavior of item animations. By default,
 RecyclerView has a non-null {@link #getcom.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.ItemAnimator() com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.ItemAnimator}, and simple
 item animations are enabled. This means that add/remove operations on the
 adapter will result in animations to add new or appearing items, removed or
 disappearing items, and moved items. If a LayoutManager returns false from
 {@link #supportsPredictiveItemAnimations}(), which is the default, and runs a
 normal layout operation during {@link #onLayoutChildren(Recycler, com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.State)}, the
 RecyclerView will have enough information to run those animations in a simple
 way. For example, the default ItemAnimator, {@link com.android.internal.widget.DefaultItemAnimator}, will
 simply fade views in and out, whether they are actually added/removed or whether
 they are moved on or off the screen due to other add/remove operations.

 &lt;p&gt;A LayoutManager wanting a better item animation experience, where items can be
 animated onto and off of the screen according to where the items exist when they
 are not on screen, then the LayoutManager should return true from
 {@link #supportsPredictiveItemAnimations}() and add additional logic to
 {@link #onLayoutChildren(Recycler, com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.State)}. Supporting predictive animations
 means that {@link #onLayoutChildren(Recycler, com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.State)} will be called twice;
 once as a &quot;pre&quot; layout step to determine where items would have been prior to
 a real layout, and again to do the &quot;real&quot; layout. In the pre-layout phase,
 items will remember their pre-layout positions to allow them to be laid out
 appropriately. Also, {@link com.android.internal.widget.ActionBarOverlayLayout.LayoutParams#isItemRemoved() removed} items will
 be returned from the scrap to help determine correct placement of other items.
 These removed items should not be added to the child list, but should be used
 to help calculate correct positioning of other views, including views that
 were not previously onscreen (referred to as APPEARING views), but whose
 pre-layout offscreen position can be determined given the extra
 information about the pre-layout removed views.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The second layout pass is the real layout in which only non-removed views
 will be used. The only additional requirement during this pass is, if
 {@link #supportsPredictiveItemAnimations}() returns true, to note which
 views exist in the child list prior to layout and which are not there after
 layout (referred to as DISAPPEARING views), and to position/layout those views
 appropriately, without regard to the actual bounds of the RecyclerView. This allows
 the animation system to know the location to which to animate these disappearing
 views.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The default LayoutManager implementations for RecyclerView handle all of these
 requirements for animations already. Clients of RecyclerView can either use one
 of these layout managers directly or look at their implementations of
 onLayoutChildren() to see how they account for the APPEARING and
 DISAPPEARING views.&lt;/p&gt;
