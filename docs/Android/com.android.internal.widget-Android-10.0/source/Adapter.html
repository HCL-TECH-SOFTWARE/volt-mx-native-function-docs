 &lt;p&gt;A view is recycled when a {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.LayoutManager} decides that it no longer
 needs to be attached to its parent {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView}. This can be because it has
 fallen out of visibility or a set of cached views represented by views still
 attached to the parent RecyclerView. If an item view has large or expensive data
 bound to it such as large bitmaps, this may be a good place to release those
 resources.&lt;/p&gt;

 sending it to RecycledViewPool. This way, if ViewHolder was holding valid information

 the View can be recycled. Keep in mind that the View in question is already removed from
 the RecyclerView.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In some cases, it is acceptable to recycle a View although it has transient state. Most
 of the time, this is a case where the transient state will be cleared in
 {@link #onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder, int)} call when View is rebound to a new position.
 For this reason, RecyclerView leaves the decision to the Adapter and uses the return
 value of this method to decide whether the View should be recycled or not.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Note that when all animations are created by {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.ItemAnimator}, you
 should never receive this callback because RecyclerView keeps those Views as children
 until their animations are complete. This callback is useful when children of the item
 views create animations which may not be easy to implement using an {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.ItemAnimator}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 You should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; fix this issue by calling

 &lt;code&gt;holder.itemView.setHasTransientState(true);&lt;/code&gt;. Each
 &lt;code&gt;View.setHasTransientState(true)&lt;/code&gt; call must be matched by a
 &lt;code&gt;View.setHasTransientState(false)&lt;/code&gt; call, otherwise, the state of the View
 may become inconsistent. You should always prefer to end or cancel animations that are
 triggering the transient state instead of handling it manually.

 &lt;p&gt;There are two different classes of data change events, item changes and structural
 changes. Item changes are when a single item has its data updated but no positional

 within the data set.&lt;/p&gt;
