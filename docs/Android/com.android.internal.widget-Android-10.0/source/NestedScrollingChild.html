 &lt;p&gt;A view starting a nested scroll promises to abide by the following contract:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The view will call startNestedScroll upon initiating a scroll operation. In the case
 of a touch scroll this corresponds to the initial {@link MotionEvent#ACTION_DOWN}.
 In the case of touch scrolling the nested scroll will be terminated automatically in
 the same manner as {@link ViewParent#requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(boolean)}.
 In the event of programmatic scrolling the caller must explicitly call
 {@link #stopNestedScroll}() to indicate the end of the nested scroll.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;startNestedScroll&lt;/code&gt; returns true, a cooperative parent was found.
 If it returns false the caller may ignore the rest of this contract until the next scroll.
 Calling startNestedScroll while a nested scroll is already in progress will return true.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;At each incremental step of the scroll the caller should invoke
 {@link #dispatchNestedPreScroll(int, int, int[], int[]) dispatchNestedPreScroll}
 once it has calculated the requested scrolling delta. If it returns true the nested scrolling
 parent at least partially consumed the scroll and the caller should adjust the amount it
 scrolls by.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;After applying the remainder of the scroll delta the caller should invoke
 {@link #dispatchNestedScroll(int, int, int, int, int[]) dispatchNestedScroll}, passing
 both the delta consumed and the delta unconsumed. A nested scrolling parent may treat
 these values differently. See
 {@link NestedScrollingParent#onNestedScroll(View, int, int, int, int)}.

 &lt;p&gt;This method should be used to indicate that a nested scrolling child has detected

 the {@link ViewConfiguration#getScaledMinimumFlingVelocity() minimum fling velocity}

 &lt;p&gt;Nested pre-fling events are to nested fling events what touch intercept is to touch
 and what nested pre-scroll is to nested scroll. &lt;code&gt;dispatchNestedPreFling&lt;/code&gt;
 offsets an opportunity for the parent view in a nested fling to fully consume the fling
 before the child view consumes it. If this method returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, a nested
 parent view consumed the fling and this view should not scroll as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For a better user experience, only one view in a nested scrolling chain should consume
 the fling at a time. If a parent view consumed the fling this method will return false.
 Custom view implementations should account for this in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;If a custom view is paged and needs to settle to a fixed page-point, do not
     call &lt;code&gt;dispatchNestedPreFling&lt;/code&gt;; consume the fling and settle to a valid
     position regardless.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;If a nested parent does consume the fling, this view should not scroll at all,
     even to settle back to a valid idle position.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Views should also not offer fling velocities to nested parent views along an axis
 where scrolling is not currently supported; a {@link android.widget.ScrollView ScrollView}
 should not offer a horizontal fling velocity to its parents since scrolling along that
 axis is not permitted and carrying velocity along that motion does not make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

@param {Number} velocityY Vertical fling velocity in pixels per second
@return {Boolean} true if a nested scrolling parent consumed the fling
