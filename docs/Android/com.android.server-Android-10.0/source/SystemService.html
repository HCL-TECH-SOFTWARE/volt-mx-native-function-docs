</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 The base class for services running in the system process. Override and implement
 the lifecycle event callback methods as needed.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The lifecycle of a SystemService:
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The constructor is called and provided with the system {@link Context}
 to initialize the system service.
 &lt;li&gt;{@link #onStart}() is called to get the service running.  The service should
 publish its binder interface at this point using
 {@link #publishBinderService(String, IBinder)}.  It may also publish additional
 local interfaces that other services within the system server may use to access
 privileged internal functions.
 &lt;li&gt;Then {@link #onBootPhase}(int) is called as many times as there are boot phases
 until {@link #PHASE_BOOT_COMPLETED} is sent, which is the last boot phase. Each phase
 is an opportunity to do special work, like acquiring optional service dependencies,
 waiting to see if SafeMode is enabled, or registering with a service that gets
 started after this one.
 &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 NOTE: All lifecycle methods are called from the system server's main looper thread.
 &lt;/p&gt;
