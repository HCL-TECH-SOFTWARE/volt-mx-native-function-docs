</span>@extends android.os.Binder

 A service designed to load and periodically save &amp;quot;randomness&amp;quot;
 for the Linux kernel RNG and to mix in data from Hardware RNG (if present)
 into the Linux RNG.

 &lt;p&gt;When a Linux system starts up, the entropy pool associated with
 {@code /dev/random} may be in a fairly predictable state.  Applications which
 depend strongly on randomness may find {@code /dev/random} or
 {@code /dev/urandom} returning predictable data.  In order to counteract
 this effect, it's helpful to carry the entropy pool information across
 shutdowns and startups.

 &lt;p&gt;On systems with Hardware RNG (/dev/hw_random), a block of output from HW
 RNG is mixed into the Linux RNG on EntropyMixer's startup and whenever
 EntropyMixer periodically runs to save a block of output from Linux RNG on
 disk. This mixing is done in a way that does not increase the Linux RNG's
 entropy estimate is not increased. This is to avoid having to trust/verify
 the quality and authenticity of the &amp;quot;randomness&amp;quot; of the HW RNG.

 &lt;p&gt;This class was modeled after the script in
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man4/random.4.html&quot;&gt;man
 4 random&lt;/a&gt;.
