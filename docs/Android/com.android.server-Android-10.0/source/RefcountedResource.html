 RefcountedResource manages references and dependencies in an exclusively acyclic graph.

 &lt;p&gt;RefcountedResource implements both explicit and implicit resource management. Creating a
 RefcountedResource object creates an explicit reference that must be freed by calling
 userRelease(). Additionally, adding this object as a child of another RefcountedResource
 object will add an implicit reference.

 &lt;p&gt;Resources are cleaned up when all references, both implicit and explicit, are released
 (ie, when userRelease() is called and when all parents have called releaseReference() on this
 object.)
