</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 This is an API for scheduling various types of jobs against the framework that will be executed
 in your application's own process.
 &lt;p&gt;
 See {@link android.app.job.JobInfo} for more description of the types of jobs that can be run
 and how to construct them. You will construct these JobInfo objects and pass them to the
 JobScheduler with {@link #schedule}(JobInfo). When the criteria declared are met, the
 system will execute this job on your application's {@link android.app.job.JobService}.
 You identify the service component that implements the logic for your job when you
 construct the JobInfo using
 {@link android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder#JobInfo.Builder(int,android.content.ComponentName)}.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 The framework will be intelligent about when it executes jobs, and attempt to batch
 and defer them as much as possible. Typically if you don't specify a deadline on a job, it
 can be run at any moment depending on the current state of the JobScheduler's internal queue.
 &lt;p&gt;
 While a job is running, the system holds a wakelock on behalf of your app.  For this reason,
 you do not need to take any action to guarantee that the device stays awake for the
 duration of the job.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;You do not
 instantiate this class directly; instead, retrieve it through
 {@link android.content.Context#getSystemService
 Context.getSystemService(Context.JOB_SCHEDULER_SERVICE)}.

<span id='android-app-job-JobScheduler-method-enqueue'>/**Similar to {@link #schedule}, but allows you to enqueue work for a new &lt;em&gt;or existing&lt;/em&gt;
</span> job.  If a job with the same ID is already scheduled, it will be replaced with the
 new {@link android.app.job.JobInfo}, but any previously enqueued work will remain and be dispatched the
 next time it runs.  If a job with the same ID is already running, the new work will be
 enqueued for it.

 &lt;p&gt;The work you enqueue is later retrieved through
 {@link android.app.job.JobParameters#dequeueWork() android.app.job.JobParameters.dequeueWork}.  Be sure to see there
 about how to process work; the act of enqueueing work changes how you should handle the
 overall lifecycle of an executing job.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It is strongly encouraged that you use the same {@link android.app.job.JobInfo} for all work you
 enqueue.  This will allow the system to optimally schedule work along with any pending
 and/or currently running work.  If the JobInfo changes from the last time the job was
 enqueued, the system will need to update the associated JobInfo, which can cause a disruption
 in execution.  In particular, this can result in any currently running job that is processing
 previous work to be stopped and restarted with the new JobInfo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It is recommended that you avoid using
 {@link android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder#setExtras(PersistableBundle)} or
 {@link android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder#setTransientExtras(Bundle)} with a JobInfo you are using to
 enqueue work.  The system will try to compare these extras with the previous JobInfo,
 but there are situations where it may get this wrong and count the JobInfo as changing.
 (That said, you should be relatively safe with a simple set of consistent data in these
 fields.)  You should never use {@link android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder#setClipData(ClipData, int)} with
 work you are enqueue, since currently this will always be treated as a different JobInfo,
 even if the ClipData contents are exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
@param {Object {JobInfo}} job The job you wish to enqueue work for. See
 {@link android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder JobInfo.Builder} for more detail on the sorts of jobs
 you can schedule.
@param {Object {JobWorkItem}} work New work to enqueue.  This will be available later when the job starts running.
