</span>@extends android.app.Service

 &lt;p&gt;HostApduService is a convenience {@link Service} class that can be
 extended to emulate an NFC card inside an Android
 service component.

 &lt;div class=&quot;special reference&quot;&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Developer Guide&lt;/h3&gt;
 For a general introduction to card emulation, see
 &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/hce.html&quot;&gt;
 Host-based Card Emulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;h3&gt;NFC Protocols&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Cards emulated by this class are based on the NFC-Forum ISO-DEP
 protocol (based on ISO/IEC 14443-4) and support processing
 command Application Protocol Data Units (APDUs) as
 defined in the ISO/IEC 7816-4 specification.

 &lt;h3&gt;Service selection&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;When a remote NFC device wants to talk to your
 service, it sends a so-called
 &quot;SELECT AID&quot; APDU as defined in the ISO/IEC 7816-4 specification.
 The AID is an application identifier defined in ISO/IEC 7816-4.

 &lt;p&gt;The registration procedure for AIDs is defined in the
 ISO/IEC 7816-5 specification. If you don't want to register an
 AID, you are free to use AIDs in the proprietary range:
 bits 8-5 of the first byte must each be set to '1'. For example,
 &quot;0xF00102030405&quot; is a proprietary AID. If you do use proprietary
 AIDs, it is recommended to choose an AID of at least 6 bytes,
 to reduce the risk of collisions with other applications that
 might be using proprietary AIDs as well.

 &lt;h3&gt;AID groups&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In some cases, a service may need to register multiple AIDs
 to implement a certain application, and it needs to be sure
 that it is the default handler for all of these AIDs (as opposed
 to some AIDs in the group going to another service).

 &lt;p&gt;An AID group is a list of AIDs that should be considered as
 belonging together by the OS. For all AIDs in an AID group, the
 OS will guarantee one of the following:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;All AIDs in the group are routed to this service
 &lt;li&gt;No AIDs in the group are routed to this service
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 In other words, there is no in-between state, where some AIDs
 in the group can be routed to this service, and some to another.
 &lt;h3&gt;AID groups and categories&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Each AID group can be associated with a category. This allows
 the Android OS to classify services, and it allows the user to
 set defaults at the category level instead of the AID level.

 &lt;p&gt;You can use
 {@link android.nfc.cardemulation.CardEmulation#isDefaultServiceForCategory(android.content.ComponentName, String)}
 to determine if your service is the default handler for a category.

 &lt;p&gt;In this version of the platform, the only known categories
 are {@link android.nfc.cardemulation.CardEmulation#CATEGORY_PAYMENT} and {@link android.nfc.cardemulation.CardEmulation#CATEGORY_OTHER}.
 AID groups without a category, or with a category that is not recognized
 by the current platform version, will automatically be
 grouped into the {@link android.nfc.cardemulation.CardEmulation#CATEGORY_OTHER} category.
 &lt;h3&gt;Service AID registration&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;To tell the platform which AIDs groups
 are requested by this service, a {@link #SERVICE_META_DATA}
 entry must be included in the declaration of the service. An
 example of a HostApduService manifest declaration is shown below:
 &lt;pre&gt; &amp;lt;service android:name=&quot;.MyHostApduService&quot; android:exported=&quot;true&quot; android:permission=&quot;android.permission.BIND_NFC_SERVICE&quot;&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;intent-filter&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;action android:name=&quot;android.nfc.cardemulation.action.HOST_APDU_SERVICE&quot;/&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;/intent-filter&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;meta-data android:name=&quot;android.nfc.cardemulation.host_apdu_ervice&quot; android:resource=&quot;@xml/apduservice&quot;/&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/service&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

 This meta-data tag points to an apduservice.xml file.
 An example of this file with a single AID group declaration is shown below:
 &lt;pre&gt;
 &amp;lt;host-apdu-service xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;
           android:description=&quot;@string/servicedesc&quot; android:requireDeviceUnlock=&quot;false&quot;&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;aid-group android:description=&quot;@string/aiddescription&quot; android:category=&quot;other&quot;&gt;
           &amp;lt;aid-filter android:name=&quot;F0010203040506&quot;/&amp;gt;
           &amp;lt;aid-filter android:name=&quot;F0394148148100&quot;/&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;/aid-group&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/host-apdu-service&amp;gt;
 &lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The {@link android.R.styleable#HostApduService &amp;lt;host-apdu-service&amp;gt;} is required
 to contain a
 {@link android.R.styleable#HostApduService_description &amp;lt;android:description&amp;gt;}
 attribute that contains a user-friendly description of the service that may be shown in UI.
 The
 {@link android.R.styleable#HostApduService_requireDeviceUnlock &amp;lt;requireDeviceUnlock&amp;gt;}
 attribute can be used to specify that the device must be unlocked before this service
 can be invoked to handle APDUs.
 &lt;p&gt;The {@link android.R.styleable#HostApduService &amp;lt;host-apdu-service&amp;gt;} must
 contain one or more {@link android.R.styleable#AidGroup &amp;lt;aid-group&amp;gt;} tags.
 Each {@link android.R.styleable#AidGroup &amp;lt;aid-group&amp;gt;} must contain one or
 more {@link android.R.styleable#AidFilter &amp;lt;aid-filter&amp;gt;} tags, each of which
 contains a single AID. The AID must be specified in hexadecimal format, and contain
 an even number of characters.
 &lt;h3&gt;AID conflict resolution&lt;/h3&gt;
 Multiple HostApduServices may be installed on a single device, and the same AID
 can be registered by more than one service. The Android platform resolves AID
 conflicts depending on which category an AID belongs to. Each category may
 have a different conflict resolution policy. For example, for some categories
 the user may be able to select a default service in the Android settings UI.
 For other categories, to policy may be to always ask the user which service
 is to be invoked in case of conflict.

 To query the conflict resolution policy for a certain category, see
 {@link android.nfc.cardemulation.CardEmulation#getSelectionModeForCategory(String)}.

 &lt;h3&gt;Data exchange&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Once the platform has resolved a &quot;SELECT AID&quot; command APDU to a specific
 service component, the &quot;SELECT AID&quot; command APDU and all subsequent
 command APDUs will be sent to that service through
 {@link #processCommandApdu(byte[], Bundle)}, until either:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The NFC link is broken&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A &quot;SELECT AID&quot; APDU is received which resolves to another service&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 These two scenarios are indicated by a call to {@link #onDeactivated}(int).

 &lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Use of this class requires the
 {@link PackageManager#FEATURE_NFC_HOST_CARD_EMULATION} to be present
 on the device.
