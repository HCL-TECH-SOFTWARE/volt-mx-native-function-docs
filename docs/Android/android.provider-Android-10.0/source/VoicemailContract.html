</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 The contract between the voicemail provider and applications. Contains
 definitions for the supported URIs and columns.

 &lt;P&gt;The content providers exposes two tables through this interface:
 &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Voicemails table: This stores the actual voicemail records. The
   columns and URIs for accessing this table are defined by the
   {@link android.provider.VoicemailContract.Voicemails} class.
   &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Status table: This provides a way for the voicemail source application
   to convey its current state to the system. The columns and URIS for
   accessing this table are defined by the {@link android.provider.VoicemailContract.Status} class.
   &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;P&gt; The minimum permission needed to access this content provider is
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#ADD_VOICEMAIL} or carrier privileges (see
 {@link android.telephony.TelephonyManager#hasCarrierPrivileges}).

 &lt;P&gt;Voicemails are inserted by what is called as a &quot;voicemail source&quot;
 application, which is responsible for syncing voicemail data between a remote
 server and the local voicemail content provider. &quot;voicemail source&quot;
 application should always set the {@link #PARAM_KEY_SOURCE_PACKAGE} in the
 URI to identify its package.

 &lt;P&gt;In addition to the {@link ContentObserver} notifications the voicemail
 provider also generates broadcast intents to notify change for applications
 that are not active and therefore cannot listen to ContentObserver
 notifications. Broadcast intents with following actions are generated:
 &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; {@link #ACTION_NEW_VOICEMAIL} is generated for each new voicemail
   inserted.
   &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; {@link Intent#ACTION_PROVIDER_CHANGED} is generated for any change
    made into the database, including new voicemail.
   &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
