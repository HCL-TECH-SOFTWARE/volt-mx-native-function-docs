</span> implements java.lang.annotation.Annotation

 Indicates that this non-SDK interface is used by apps. A non-SDK interface is a
 class member (field or method) that is not part of the public SDK. Since the
 member is not part of the SDK, usage by apps is not supported.

 &lt;h2&gt;If you are an Android App developer&lt;/h2&gt;

 This annotation indicates that you may be able to access the member, but that
 this access is discouraged and not supported by Android. If there is a value
 for {@link #maxTargetSdk}() on the annotation, access will be restricted based
 on the {@code targetSdkVersion} value set in your manifest.

 &lt;p&gt;Fields and methods annotated with this are likely to be restricted, changed
 or removed in future Android releases. If you rely on these members for
 functionality that is not otherwise supported by Android, consider filing a
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://g.co/dev/appcompat&quot;&gt;feature request&lt;/a&gt;.

 &lt;h2&gt;If you are an Android OS developer&lt;/h2&gt;

 This annotation acts as a heads up that changing a given method or field
 may affect apps, potentially breaking them when the next Android version is
 released. In some cases, for members that are heavily used, this annotation
 may imply restrictions on changes to the member.

 &lt;p&gt;This annotation also results in access to the member being permitted by the
 runtime, with a warning being generated in debug builds. Which apps can access
 the member is determined by the value of {@link #maxTargetSdk}().

 &lt;p&gt;For more details, see go/UnsupportedAppUsage.

trackingBug : function(  ) {},

<span id='android-annotation-UnsupportedAppUsage-method-maxTargetSdk'>/**Indicates that usage of this API is limited to apps based on their target SDK version.
</span>
 &lt;p&gt;Access to the API is allowed if the targetSdkVersion in the apps manifest is no greater
 than this value. Access checks are performed at runtime.

 &lt;p&gt;This is used to give app developers a grace period to migrate off a non-SDK interface.
 When making Android version N, existing APIs can have a maxTargetSdk of N-1 added to them.
 Developers must then migrate off the API when their app is updated in future, but it will
 continue working in the meantime.

 &lt;p&gt;Possible values are:
 &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;
         {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#O} or {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#P},
         to limit access to apps targeting these SDKs (or earlier).
     &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;
         absent (default value) - All apps can access this API, but doing so may result in
         warnings in the log, UI warnings (on developer builds) and/or strictmode violations.
         The API is likely to be further restricted in future.
     &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;/ul&gt;

 Note, if this is set to {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#O}, apps targeting O
 maintenance releases will also be allowed to use the API, and similarly for any future
 maintenance releases of P.
@return {Number} The maximum value for an apps targetSdkVersion in order to access this API.
