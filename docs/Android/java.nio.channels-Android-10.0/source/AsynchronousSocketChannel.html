</span> implements java.nio.channels.AsynchronousByteChannel

 implements java.nio.channels.NetworkChannel

@extends java.lang.Object

 An asynchronous channel for stream-oriented connecting sockets.

 &lt;p&gt; Asynchronous socket channels are created in one of two ways. A newly-created
 {@code AsynchronousSocketChannel} is created by invoking one of the {@link #open open} methods defined by this class. A newly-created channel is open but
 not yet connected. A connected {@code AsynchronousSocketChannel} is created
 when a connection is made to the socket of an {@link java.nio.channels.AsynchronousServerSocketChannel}.
 It is not possible to create an asynchronous socket channel for an arbitrary,
 pre-existing {@link java.net.Socket socket}.

 &lt;p&gt; A newly-created channel is connected by invoking its {@link #connect connect}
 method; once connected, a channel remains connected until it is closed.  Whether
 or not a socket channel is connected may be determined by invoking its {@link #getRemoteAddress getRemoteAddress} method. An attempt to invoke an I/O
 operation upon an unconnected channel will cause a {@link java.nio.channels.NotYetConnectedException}
 to be thrown.

 &lt;p&gt; Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
 They support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one read operation
 and one write operation can be outstanding at any time.
 If a thread initiates a read operation before a previous read operation has
 completed then a {@link java.nio.channels.ReadPendingException} will be thrown. Similarly, an
 attempt to initiate a write operation before a previous write has completed
 will throw a {@link java.nio.channels.WritePendingException}.

 &lt;p&gt; Socket options are configured using the {@link #setOption(SocketOption,Object)
 setOption} method. Asynchronous socket channels support the following options:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;table border summary=&quot;Socket options&quot;&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;th&gt;Option Name&lt;/th&gt;
     &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_SNDBUF SO_SNDBUF} &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; The size of the socket send buffer &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF} &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; The size of the socket receive buffer &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_KEEPALIVE SO_KEEPALIVE} &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; Keep connection alive &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR} &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; Re-use address &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#TCP_NODELAY TCP_NODELAY} &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; Disable the Nagle algorithm &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.

 &lt;h2&gt;Timeouts&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; The {@link #read(ByteBuffer,long,TimeUnit,Object,CompletionHandler) read}
 and {@link #write(ByteBuffer,long,TimeUnit,Object,CompletionHandler) write}
 methods defined by this class allow a timeout to be specified when initiating
 a read or write operation. If the timeout elapses before an operation completes
 then the operation completes with the exception {@link java.nio.channels.InterruptedByTimeoutException}. A timeout may leave the channel, or the
 underlying connection, in an inconsistent state. Where the implementation
 cannot guarantee that bytes have not been read from the channel then it puts
 the channel into an implementation specific &lt;em&gt;error state&lt;/em&gt;. A subsequent
 attempt to initiate a {@code read} operation causes an unspecified runtime
 exception to be thrown. Similarly if a {@code write} operation times out and
 the implementation cannot guarantee bytes have not been written to the
 channel then further attempts to {@code write} to the channel cause an
 unspecified runtime exception to be thrown. When a timeout elapses then the
 state of the {@link ByteBuffer}, or the sequence of buffers, for the I/O
 operation is not defined. Buffers should be discarded or at least care must
 be taken to ensure that the buffers are not accessed while the channel remains
 open. All methods that accept timeout parameters treat values less than or
 equal to zero to mean that the I/O operation does not timeout.
