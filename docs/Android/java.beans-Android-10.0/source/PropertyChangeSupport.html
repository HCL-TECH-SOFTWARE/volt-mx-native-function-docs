</span> implements java.io.Serializable

@extends java.lang.Object

 This is a utility class that can be used by beans that support bound
 properties.  It manages a list of listeners and dispatches
 {@link java.beans.PropertyChangeEvent}s to them.  You can use an instance of this class
 as a member field of your bean and delegate these types of work to it.
 The {@link java.beans.PropertyChangeListener} can be registered for all properties
 or for a property specified by name.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Here is an example of {@code PropertyChangeSupport} usage that follows
 the rules and recommendations laid out in the JavaBeans&amp;trade; specification:
 &lt;pre&gt;
 public class MyBean {
     private final PropertyChangeSupport pcs = new PropertyChangeSupport(this);

     public void addPropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener) {
         this.pcs.addPropertyChangeListener(listener);
     }

     public void removePropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener) {
         this.pcs.removePropertyChangeListener(listener);
     }

     private String value;

     public String getValue() {
         return this.value;
     }

     public void setValue(String newValue) {
         String oldValue = this.value;
         this.value = newValue;
         this.pcs.firePropertyChange(&quot;value&quot;, oldValue, newValue);
     }

     [...]
 }
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 A {@code PropertyChangeSupport} instance is thread-safe.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This class is serializable.  When it is serialized it will save
 (and restore) any listeners that are themselves serializable.  Any
 non-serializable listeners will be skipped during serialization.
