</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 A Drawable is a general abstraction for &quot;something that can be drawn.&quot;  Most
 often you will deal with Drawable as the type of resource retrieved for
 drawing things to the screen; the Drawable class provides a generic API for
 dealing with an underlying visual resource that may take a variety of forms.
 Unlike a {@link android.view.View}, a Drawable does not have any facility to
 receive events or otherwise interact with the user.

 &lt;p&gt;In addition to simple drawing, Drawable provides a number of generic
 mechanisms for its client to interact with what is being drawn:

 &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt; The {@link #setBounds} method &lt;var&gt;must&lt;/var&gt; be called to tell the
     Drawable where it is drawn and how large it should be.  All Drawables
     should respect the requested size, often simply by scaling their
     imagery.  A client can find the preferred size for some Drawables with
     the {@link #getIntrinsicHeight} and {@link #getIntrinsicWidth} methods.

     &lt;li&gt; The {@link #getPadding} method can return from some Drawables
     information about how to frame content that is placed inside of them.
     For example, a Drawable that is intended to be the frame for a button
     widget would need to return padding that correctly places the label
     inside of itself.

     &lt;li&gt; The {@link #setState} method allows the client to tell the Drawable
     in which state it is to be drawn, such as &quot;focused&quot;, &quot;selected&quot;, etc.
     Some drawables may modify their imagery based on the selected state.

     &lt;li&gt; The {@link #setLevel} method allows the client to supply a single
     continuous controller that can modify the Drawable is displayed, such as
     a battery level or progress level.  Some drawables may modify their
     imagery based on the current level.

     &lt;li&gt; A Drawable can perform animations by calling back to its client
     through the {@link android.graphics.drawable.Drawable.Callback} interface.  All clients should support this
     interface (via {@link #setCallback}) so that animations will work.  A
     simple way to do this is through the system facilities such as
     {@link android.view.View#setBackground(Drawable)} and
     {@link android.widget.ImageView}.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 Though usually not visible to the application, Drawables may take a variety
 of forms:

 &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bitmap&lt;/b&gt;: the simplest Drawable, a PNG or JPEG image.
     &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Nine Patch&lt;/b&gt;: an extension to the PNG format allows it to
     specify information about how to stretch it and place things inside of
     it.
     &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vector&lt;/b&gt;: a drawable defined in an XML file as a set of points,
     lines, and curves along with its associated color information. This type
     of drawable can be scaled without loss of display quality.
     &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Shape&lt;/b&gt;: contains simple drawing commands instead of a raw
     bitmap, allowing it to resize better in some cases.
     &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Layers&lt;/b&gt;: a compound drawable, which draws multiple underlying
     drawables on top of each other.
     &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;States&lt;/b&gt;: a compound drawable that selects one of a set of
     drawables based on its state.
     &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Levels&lt;/b&gt;: a compound drawable that selects one of a set of
     drawables based on its level.
     &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Scale&lt;/b&gt;: a compound drawable with a single child drawable,
     whose overall size is modified based on the current level.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;a name=&quot;Custom&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Custom drawables&lt;/h3&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 All versions of Android allow the Drawable class to be extended and used at
 run time in place of framework-provided drawable classes. Starting in
 {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#N API 24}, custom drawables classes
 may also be used in XML.
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Custom drawable classes are only accessible from
 within your application package. Other applications will not be able to load
 them.
 &lt;p&gt;
 At a minimum, custom drawable classes must implement the abstract methods on
 Drawable and should override the {@link android.graphics.drawable.Drawable#draw(Canvas)} method to
 draw content.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Custom drawables classes may be used in XML in multiple ways:
 &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;
         Using the fully-qualified class name as the XML element name. For
         this method, the custom drawable class must be a public top-level
         class.
 &lt;pre&gt;
 &amp;lt;com.myapp.MyCustomDrawable xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;
     android:color=&quot;#ffff0000&quot; /&amp;gt;
 &lt;/pre&gt;
     &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;
         Using &lt;em&gt;drawable&lt;/em&gt; as the XML element name and specifying the
         fully-qualified class name from the &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt; attribute. This
         method may be used for both public top-level classes and public
         static inner classes.
 &lt;pre&gt;
 &amp;lt;drawable xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;
     class=&quot;com.myapp.MyTopLevelClass$InnerCustomDrawable&quot;
     android:color=&quot;#ffff0000&quot; /&amp;gt;
 &lt;/pre&gt;
     &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 {@link android.graphics.PixelFormat#TRANSPARENT}, or
 {@link android.graphics.PixelFormat#OPAQUE}.

 &lt;p&gt;An OPAQUE drawable is one that draws all all content within its bounds, completely
 covering anything behind the drawable. A TRANSPARENT drawable is one that draws nothing
 within its bounds, allowing everything behind it to show through. A TRANSLUCENT drawable
 is a drawable in any other state, where the drawable will draw some, but not all,
 of the content within its bounds and at least some content behind the drawable will
 be visible. If the visibility of the drawable's contents cannot be determined, the
 safest/best return value is TRANSLUCENT.

 &lt;p&gt;Generally a Drawable should be as conservative as possible with the
 value it returns.  For example, if it contains multiple child drawables
 and only shows one of them at a time, if only one of the children is
 TRANSLUCENT and the others are OPAQUE then TRANSLUCENT should be
 returned.  You can use the method {@link #resolveOpacity} to perform a
 standard reduction of two opacities to the appropriate single output.

 &lt;p&gt;Note that the returned value does not necessarily take into account a
 custom alpha or color filter that has been applied by the client through
 the {@link #setAlpha} or {@link #setColorFilter} methods. Some subclasses,
 such as {@link android.graphics.drawable.BitmapDrawable}, {@link android.graphics.drawable.ColorDrawable}, and {@link android.graphics.drawable.GradientDrawable},
