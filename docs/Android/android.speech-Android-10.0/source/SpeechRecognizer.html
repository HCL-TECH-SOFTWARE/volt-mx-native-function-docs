</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 This class provides access to the speech recognition service. This service allows access to the
 speech recognizer. Do not instantiate this class directly, instead, call
 {@link android.speech.SpeechRecognizer#createandroid.speech.SpeechRecognizer(Context)}. This class's methods must be
 invoked only from the main application thread. 

 &lt;p&gt;The implementation of this API is likely to stream audio to remote servers to perform speech
 recognition. As such this API is not intended to be used for continuous recognition, which would
 consume a significant amount of battery and bandwidth.

 &lt;p&gt;Please note that the application must have {@link android.Manifest.permission#RECORD_AUDIO}
 permission to use this class.
