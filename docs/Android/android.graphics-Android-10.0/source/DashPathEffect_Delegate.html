</span>@extends android.graphics.PathEffect_Delegate

 Delegate implementing the native methods of android.graphics.DashPathEffect

 Through the layoutlib_create tool, the original native methods of DashPathEffect have been
 replaced by calls to methods of the same name in this delegate class.

 This class behaves like the original native implementation, but in Java, keeping previously
 native data into its own objects and mapping them to int that are sent back and forth between
 it and the original DashPathEffect class.

 Because this extends {@link android.graphics.PathEffect_Delegate}, there's no need to use a
 {@link DelegateManager}, as all the PathEffect classes will be added to the manager owned by
 {@link android.graphics.PathEffect_Delegate}.
