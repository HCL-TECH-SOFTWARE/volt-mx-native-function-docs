 This method is relevant to NetworkSpecifier objects used by agents - those are shared with
 apps by default. Some agents may store sensitive matching information in the specifier,
 e.g. a Wi-Fi SSID (which should not be shared since it may leak location). Those classes
 can redact to a null. Other agents use the Network Specifier to share public information
 with apps - those should not be redacted.
