</span> implements android.os.Parcelable

@extends java.lang.Object

 A curve defining the network score over a range of RSSI values.

 &lt;p&gt;For each RSSI bucket, the score may be any byte. Scores have no absolute meaning and are only
 considered relative to other scores assigned by the same scorer. Networks with no score are
 treated equivalently to a network with score {@link Byte#MIN_VALUE}, and will not be used.

 &lt;p&gt;For example, consider a curve starting at -110 dBm with a bucket width of 10 and the
 following buckets: {@code [-20, -10, 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]}.
 This represents a linear curve between -110 dBm and 30 dBm. It scores progressively higher at
 stronger signal strengths.

 &lt;p&gt;A network can be assigned a fixed score independent of RSSI by setting
 {@link #rssiBuckets} to a one-byte array whose element is the fixed score. {@link #start}
 should be set to the lowest RSSI value at which this fixed score should apply, and
 {@link #bucketWidth} should be set such that {@code start + bucketWidth} is equal to the
 highest RSSI value at which this fixed score should apply.

 &lt;p&gt;Note that RSSI values below -110 dBm or above 30 dBm are unlikely to cause any difference
 in connectivity behavior from those endpoints. That is, the connectivity framework will treat
 a network with a -120 dBm signal exactly as it would treat one with a -110 dBm signal.
 Therefore, graphs which specify scores outside this range may be truncated to this range by
 the system.
