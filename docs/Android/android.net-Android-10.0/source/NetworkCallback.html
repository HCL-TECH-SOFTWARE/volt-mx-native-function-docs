</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Base class for {@code NetworkRequest} callbacks. Used for notifications about network
 changes. Should be extended by applications wanting notifications.

 A {@code NetworkCallback} is registered by calling
 {@link #requestandroid.net.Network(android.net.NetworkRequest, android.net.NetworkCallback)},
 {@link #registerandroid.net.NetworkCallback(android.net.NetworkRequest, android.net.NetworkCallback)},
 or {@link #registerDefaultNetworkCallback}(NetworkCallback). A {@code NetworkCallback} is
 unregistered by calling {@link #unregisterNetworkCallback}(NetworkCallback).
 A {@code NetworkCallback} should be registered at most once at any time.
 A {@code NetworkCallback} that has been unregistered can be registered again.

 Most applications &lt;b&gt;should not&lt;/b&gt; act on this callback, and should instead use
