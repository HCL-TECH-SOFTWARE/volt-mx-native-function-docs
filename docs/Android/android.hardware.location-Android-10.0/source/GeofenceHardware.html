</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 This class handles geofences managed by various hardware subsystems. It contains
 the public APIs that is needed to accomplish the task.

 &lt;p&gt;The APIs should not be called directly by the app developers. A higher level api
 which abstracts the hardware should be used instead. All the checks are done by the higher
 level public API. Any needed locking should be handled by the higher level API.

 &lt;p&gt; There are 3 states associated with a Geofence: Inside, Outside, Unknown.
 There are 3 transitions: {@link #GEOFENCE_ENTERED}, {@link #GEOFENCE_EXITED},
 {@link #GEOFENCE_UNCERTAIN}. The APIs only expose the transitions.

 &lt;p&gt; Inside state: The hardware subsystem is reasonably confident that the user is inside
 the geofence. Outside state: The hardware subsystem is reasonably confident that the user
 is outside the geofence Unknown state: Unknown state can be interpreted as a state in which the
 monitoring subsystem isn't confident enough that the user is either inside or
 outside the Geofence. If the accuracy does not improve for a sufficient period of time,
 the {@link #GEOFENCE_UNCERTAIN} transition would be triggered. If the accuracy improves later,
 an appropriate transition would be triggered. The &quot;reasonably confident&quot; parameter
 depends on the hardware system and the positioning algorithms used.
 For instance, {@link #MONITORING_TYPE_GPS_HARDWARE} uses 95% as a confidence level.
