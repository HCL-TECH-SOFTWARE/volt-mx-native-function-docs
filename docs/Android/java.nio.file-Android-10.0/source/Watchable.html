 &lt;p&gt; This interface defines the {@link #register register} method to register
 the object with a {@link java.nio.file.WatchService} returning a {@link java.nio.file.WatchKey} to
 represent the registration. An object may be registered with more than one
 watch service. Registration with a watch service is cancelled by invoking the
 key's {@link java.nio.file.WatchKey#cancel cancel} method.

 &lt;p&gt; If the file system object identified by this object is currently
 registered with the watch service then the watch key, representing that
 registration, is returned after changing the event set or modifiers to
 those specified by the {@code events} and {@code modifiers} parameters.
 Changing the event set does not cause pending events for the object to be
 discarded. Objects are automatically registered for the {@link java.nio.file.StandardWatchEventKinds#OVERFLOW OVERFLOW} event. This event is not
 required to be present in the array of events.

 &lt;p&gt; Otherwise the file system object has not yet been registered with the
 given watch service, so it is registered and the resulting new key is
 returned.

 &lt;p&gt; Implementations of this interface should specify the events they
 support.
