</span> implements java.io.Closeable

@extends java.lang.Object

 Provides an interface to a file system and is the factory for objects to
 access files and other objects in the file system.

 &lt;p&gt; The default file system, obtained by invoking the {@link java.nio.file.FileSystems#getDefault
 java.nio.file.FileSystems.getDefault} method, provides access to the file system that is
 accessible to the Java virtual machine. The {@link java.nio.file.FileSystems} class defines
 methods to create file systems that provide access to other types of (custom)
 file systems.

 &lt;p&gt; A file system is the factory for several types of objects:

 &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link #getPath getPath} method converts a system dependent
     &lt;em&gt;path string&lt;/em&gt;, returning a {@link java.nio.file.Path} object that may be used
     to locate and access a file. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link #getPathMatcher  getPathMatcher} method is used
     to create a {@link java.nio.file.PathMatcher} that performs match operations on
     paths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link #getFileStores getFileStores} method returns an iterator
     over the underlying {@link java.nio.file.FileStore file-stores}. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link #getUserPrincipalLookupService getUserPrincipalLookupService}
     method returns the {@link UserPrincipalLookupService} to lookup users or
     groups by name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link #newWatchService newWatchService} method creates a
     {@link java.nio.file.WatchService} that may be used to watch objects for changes and
     events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; File systems vary greatly. In some cases the file system is a single
 hierarchy of files with one top-level root directory. In other cases it may
 have several distinct file hierarchies, each with its own top-level root
 directory. The {@link #getRootDirectories getRootDirectories} method may be
 used to iterate over the root directories in the file system. A file system
 is typically composed of one or more underlying {@link java.nio.file.FileStore file-stores}
 that provide the storage for the files. Theses file stores can also vary in
 the features they support, and the file attributes or &lt;em&gt;meta-data&lt;/em&gt; that
 they associate with files.

 &lt;p&gt; A file system is open upon creation and can be closed by invoking its
 {@link #close() close} method. Once closed, any further attempt to access
 objects in the file system cause {@link java.nio.file.ClosedFileSystemException} to be
 thrown. File systems created by the default {@link java.nio.file.FileSystemProvider provider}
 cannot be closed.

 &lt;p&gt; A {@code FileSystem} can provide read-only or read-write access to the
 file system. Whether or not a file system provides read-only access is
 established when the {@code FileSystem} is created and can be tested by invoking
 its {@link #isReadOnly() isReadOnly} method. Attempts to write to file stores
 by means of an object associated with a read-only file system throws {@link java.nio.file.ReadOnlyFileSystemException}.

 &lt;p&gt; File systems are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. The {@link #close close} method may be invoked at any time to close a file system but
 whether a file system is &lt;i&gt;asynchronously closeable&lt;/i&gt; is provider specific
 and therefore unspecified. In other words, if a thread is accessing an
 object in a file system, and another thread invokes the {@code close} method
 then it may require to block until the first operation is complete. Closing
 a file system causes all open channels, watch services, and other {@link Closeable closeable} objects associated with the file system to be closed.

 &lt;p&gt; Closing a file system will close all open {@link java.nio.channels.Channel channels}, {@link java.nio.file.DirectoryStream directory-streams},

</span>
 &lt;p&gt; A file system provides access to a file store that may be composed
 of a number of distinct file hierarchies, each with its own top-level

 the returned iterator corresponds to the root directory of a distinct
 file hierarchy. The order of the elements is not defined. The file
 hierarchies may change during the lifetime of the Java virtual machine.
 For example, in some implementations, the insertion of removable media
 may result in the creation of a new file hierarchy with its own
 top-level directory.

 &lt;p&gt; When a security manager is installed, it is invoked to check access
 to the each root directory. If denied, the root directory is not returned
 by the iterator. In the case of the default provider, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String)} method is invoked to check read access
 to each root directory. It is system dependent if the permission checks
 are done when the iterator is obtained or during iteration.

*/
getRootDirectories : function(  ) {},

<span id='java-nio-file-FileSystem-method-getFileStores'>/**Returns an object to iterate over the underlying file stores.
</span>
 &lt;p&gt; The elements of the returned iterator are the {@link java.nio.file.FileStore java.nio.file.FileStores} for this file system. The order of the elements is
 not defined and the file stores may change during the lifetime of the
 Java virtual machine. When an I/O error occurs, perhaps because a file
 store is not accessible, then it is not returned by the iterator.

 &lt;p&gt; In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
 installed, the security manager is invoked to check {@link RuntimePermission}&lt;tt&gt;(&quot;getFileStoreAttributes&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt;. If denied, then
 no file stores are returned by the iterator. In addition, the security
 manager's {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String)} method is invoked to
 check read access to the file store's &lt;em&gt;top-most&lt;/em&gt; directory. If
 denied, the file store is not returned by the iterator. It is system
 dependent if the permission checks are done when the iterator is obtained
 or during iteration.

 &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Usage Example:&lt;/b&gt;
 Suppose we want to print the space usage for all file stores:
 &lt;pre&gt;
     for (FileStore store: FileSystems.getDefault().getFileStores()) {
         long total = store.getTotalSpace() / 1024;
         long used = (store.getTotalSpace() - store.getUnallocatedSpace()) / 1024;
         long avail = store.getUsableSpace() / 1024;
         System.out.format(&quot;%-20s %12d %12d %12d%n&quot;, store, total, used, avail);

 underlying {@link java.nio.file.FileStore} supports the file attributes identified by a
 file attribute view.
@return {Object {java.util.Set}} An unmodifiable set of the names of the supported file attribute

<span id='java-nio-file-FileSystem-method-getPath'>/**Converts a path string, or a sequence of strings that when joined form
</span> a path string, to a {@code Path}. If {@code more} does not specify any
 elements then the value of the {@code first} parameter is the path string
 to convert. If {@code more} specifies one or more elements then each
 non-empty string, including {@code first}, is considered to be a sequence
 of name elements (see {@link java.nio.file.Path}) and is joined to form a path string.
 The details as to how the Strings are joined is provider specific but
 typically they will be joined using the {@link #getSeparator
 name-separator} as the separator. For example, if the name separator is
 &quot;{@code /}&quot; and {@code getPath(&quot;/foo&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;,&quot;gus&quot;)} is invoked, then the
 path string {@code &quot;/foo/bar/gus&quot;} is converted to a {@code Path}.
 A {@code Path} representing an empty path is returned if {@code first}
 is the empty string and {@code more} does not contain any non-empty
 strings.

 &lt;p&gt; The parsing and conversion to a path object is inherently
 implementation dependent. In the simplest case, the path string is rejected,
 and {@link java.nio.file.InvalidPathException} thrown, if the path string contains
 characters that cannot be converted to characters that are &lt;em&gt;legal&lt;/em&gt;
 to the file store. For example, on UNIX systems, the NUL (&amp;#92;u0000)
 character is not allowed to be present in a path. An implementation may
 choose to reject path strings that contain names that are longer than those
 allowed by any file store, and where an implementation supports a complex
 path syntax, it may choose to reject path strings that are &lt;em&gt;badly
 formed&lt;/em&gt;.

 &lt;p&gt; In the case of the default provider, path strings are parsed based
 on the definition of paths at the platform or virtual file system level.
 For example, an operating system may not allow specific characters to be
 present in a file name, but a specific underlying file store may impose
 different or additional restrictions on the set of legal
 characters.

 &lt;p&gt; This method throws {@link java.nio.file.InvalidPathException} when the path string
 cannot be converted to a path. Where possible, and where applicable,
 the exception is created with an {@link java.nio.file.InvalidPathException#getIndex
 index} value indicating the first position in the {@code path} parameter
 that caused the path string to be rejected.

<span id='java-nio-file-FileSystem-method-getPathMatcher'>/**Returns a {@code PathMatcher} that performs match operations on the
</span> {@code String} representation of {@link java.nio.file.Path} objects by interpreting a
 given pattern.

 The {@code syntaxAndPattern} parameter identifies the syntax and the
 pattern and takes the form:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;i&gt;syntax&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;pattern&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 where {@code ':'} stands for itself.

 &lt;p&gt; A {@code FileSystem} implementation supports the &quot;{@code glob}&quot; and
 &quot;{@code regex}&quot; syntaxes, and may support others. The value of the syntax
 component is compared without regard to case.

 &lt;p&gt; When the syntax is &quot;{@code glob}&quot; then the {@code String}
 representation of the path is matched using a limited pattern language
 that resembles regular expressions but with a simpler syntax. For example:

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; summary=&quot;Pattern Language&quot;&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;{@code *.java}&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Matches a path that represents a file name ending in {@code .java}&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;{@code *.*}&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Matches file names containing a dot&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;{@code *.{java,class}}&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Matches file names ending with {@code .java} or {@code .class}&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;{@code foo.?}&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Matches file names starting with {@code foo.} and a single
   character extension&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;#47;home&amp;#47;*&amp;#47;*&lt;/tt&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Matches &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#47;home&amp;#47;gus&amp;#47;data&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;#47;home&amp;#47;**&lt;/tt&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Matches &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#47;home&amp;#47;gus&lt;/tt&gt; and
   &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#47;home&amp;#47;gus&amp;#47;data&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;

 &lt;/table&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; The following rules are used to interpret glob patterns:

 &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@code *} character matches zero or more {@link Character
   characters} of a {@link java.nio.file.Path#getName(int) name} component without
   crossing directory boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@code **} characters matches zero or more {@link Character
   characters} crossing directory boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@code ?} character matches exactly one character of a
   name component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The backslash character ({@code \}) is used to escape characters
   that would otherwise be interpreted as special characters. The expression
   {@code \\} matches a single backslash and &quot;\{&quot; matches a left brace
   for example.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@code [ ]} characters are a &lt;i&gt;bracket expression&lt;/i&gt; that
   match a single character of a name component out of a set of characters.
   For example, {@code [abc]} matches {@code &quot;a&quot;}, {@code &quot;b&quot;}, or {@code &quot;c&quot;}.
   The hyphen ({@code -}) may be used to specify a range so {@code [a-z]}
   specifies a range that matches from {@code &quot;a&quot;} to {@code &quot;z&quot;} (inclusive).
   These forms can be mixed so [abce-g] matches {@code &quot;a&quot;}, {@code &quot;b&quot;},
   {@code &quot;c&quot;}, {@code &quot;e&quot;}, {@code &quot;f&quot;} or {@code &quot;g&quot;}. If the character
   after the {@code [} is a {@code !} then it is used for negation so {@code
   [!a-c]} matches any character except {@code &quot;a&quot;}, {@code &quot;b&quot;}, or {@code
   &quot;c&quot;}.
   &lt;p&gt; Within a bracket expression the {@code *}, {@code ?} and {@code \}
   characters match themselves. The ({@code -}) character matches itself if
   it is the first character within the brackets, or the first character
   after the {@code !} if negating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@code { }} characters are a group of subpatterns, where
   the group matches if any subpattern in the group matches. The {@code &quot;,&quot;}
   character is used to separate the subpatterns. Groups cannot be nested.
   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leading period&lt;tt&gt;&amp;#47;&lt;/tt&gt;dot characters in file name are
   treated as regular characters in match operations. For example,
   the {@code &quot;*&quot;} glob pattern matches file name {@code &quot;.login&quot;}.
   The {@link java.nio.file.Files#isHidden} method may be used to test whether a file
   is considered hidden.
   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; All other characters match themselves in an implementation
   dependent manner. This includes characters representing any {@link java.nio.file.FileSystem#getSeparator name-separators}. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The matching of {@link java.nio.file.Path#getRoot root} components is highly
   implementation-dependent and is not specified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; When the syntax is &quot;{@code regex}&quot; then the pattern component is a
 regular expression as defined by the {@link java.util.regex.Pattern}
 class.

 &lt;p&gt;  For both the glob and regex syntaxes, the matching details, such as
 whether the matching is case sensitive, are implementation-dependent
 and therefore not specified.
