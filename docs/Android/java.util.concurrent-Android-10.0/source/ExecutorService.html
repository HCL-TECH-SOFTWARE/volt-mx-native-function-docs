</span> implements java.util.concurrent.Executor

 An {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor} that provides methods to manage termination and
 methods that can produce a {@link java.util.concurrent.Future} for tracking progress of
 one or more asynchronous tasks.

 &lt;p&gt;An {@code ExecutorService} can be shut down, which will cause
 it to reject new tasks.  Two different methods are provided for
 shutting down an {@code ExecutorService}. The {@link #shutdown}
 method will allow previously submitted tasks to execute before
 terminating, while the {@link #shutdownNow} method prevents waiting
 tasks from starting and attempts to stop currently executing tasks.
 Upon termination, an executor has no tasks actively executing, no
 tasks awaiting execution, and no new tasks can be submitted.  An
 unused {@code ExecutorService} should be shut down to allow
 reclamation of its resources.

 &lt;p&gt;Method {@code submit} extends base method {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor#execute(Runnable)} by creating and returning a {@link java.util.concurrent.Future}
 that can be used to cancel execution and/or wait for completion.
 Methods {@code invokeAny} and {@code invokeAll} perform the most
 commonly useful forms of bulk execution, executing a collection of
 tasks and then waiting for at least one, or all, to
 complete. (Class {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorCompletionService} can be used to
 write customized variants of these methods.)

 &lt;p&gt;The {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors} class provides factory methods for the
 executor services provided in this package.

 &lt;h3&gt;Usage Examples&lt;/h3&gt;

 Here is a sketch of a network service in which threads in a thread
 pool service incoming requests. It uses the preconfigured {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors#newFixedThreadPool} factory method:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class NetworkService implements Runnable {
   private final ServerSocket serverSocket;
   private final ExecutorService pool;

   public NetworkService(int port, int poolSize)
       throws IOException {
     serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);
     pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(poolSize);
   }

   public void run() { // run the service
     try {
       for (;;) {
         pool.execute(new Handler(serverSocket.accept()));
       }
     } catch (IOException ex) {
       pool.shutdown();
     }
   }
 }

 class Handler implements Runnable {
   private final Socket socket;
   Handler(Socket socket) { this.socket = socket; }
   public void run() {
     // read and service request on socket
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 The following method shuts down an {@code ExecutorService} in two phases,
 first by calling {@code shutdown} to reject incoming tasks, and then
 calling {@code shutdownNow}, if necessary, to cancel any lingering tasks:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 void shutdownAndAwaitTermination(ExecutorService pool) {
   pool.shutdown(); // Disable new tasks from being submitted
   try {
     // Wait a while for existing tasks to terminate
     if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
       pool.shutdownNow(); // Cancel currently executing tasks
       // Wait a while for tasks to respond to being cancelled
       if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS))
           System.err.println(&quot;Pool did not terminate&quot;);
     }
   } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
     // (Re-)Cancel if current thread also interrupted
     pool.shutdownNow();
     // Preserve interrupt status
     Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to the
 submission of a {@code Runnable} or {@code Callable} task to an
 {@code ExecutorService}
 &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 any actions taken by that task, which in turn &lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt; the
 result is retrieved via {@code Future.get()}.
