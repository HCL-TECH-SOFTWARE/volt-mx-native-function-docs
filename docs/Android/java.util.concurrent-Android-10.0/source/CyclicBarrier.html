</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 A synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to all wait for
 each other to reach a common barrier point.  CyclicBarriers are
 useful in programs involving a fixed sized party of threads that
 must occasionally wait for each other. The barrier is called
 &lt;em&gt;cyclic&lt;/em&gt; because it can be re-used after the waiting threads
 are released.

 &lt;p&gt;A {@code CyclicBarrier} supports an optional {@link Runnable} command
 that is run once per barrier point, after the last thread in the party
 arrives, but before any threads are released.
 This &lt;em&gt;barrier action&lt;/em&gt; is useful
 for updating shared-state before any of the parties continue.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample usage:&lt;/b&gt; Here is an example of using a barrier in a
 parallel decomposition design:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class Solver {
   final int N;
   final float[][] data;
   final CyclicBarrier barrier;

   class Worker implements Runnable {
     int myRow;
     Worker(int row) { myRow = row; }
     public void run() {
       while (!done()) {
         processRow(myRow);

         try {
           barrier.await();
         } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
           return;
         } catch (BrokenBarrierException ex) {
           return;
         }
       }
     }
   }

   public Solver(float[][] matrix) {
     data = matrix;
     N = matrix.length;
     Runnable barrierAction =
       new Runnable() { public void run() { mergeRows(...); }};
     barrier = new CyclicBarrier(N, barrierAction);

     List&lt;Thread&gt; threads = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(N);
     for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
       Thread thread = new Thread(new Worker(i));
       threads.add(thread);
       thread.start();
     }

     // wait until done
     for (Thread thread : threads)
       thread.join();
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 Here, each worker thread processes a row of the matrix then waits at the
 barrier until all rows have been processed. When all rows are processed
 the supplied {@link Runnable} barrier action is executed and merges the
 rows. If the merger
 determines that a solution has been found then {@code done()} will return
 {@code true} and each worker will terminate.

 &lt;p&gt;If the barrier action does not rely on the parties being suspended when
 it is executed, then any of the threads in the party could execute that
 action when it is released. To facilitate this, each invocation of
 {@link #await} returns the arrival index of that thread at the barrier.
 You can then choose which thread should execute the barrier action, for
 example:
 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 if (barrier.await() == 0) {
   // log the completion of this iteration
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The {@code CyclicBarrier} uses an all-or-none breakage model
 for failed synchronization attempts: If a thread leaves a barrier
 point prematurely because of interruption, failure, or timeout, all
 other threads waiting at that barrier point will also leave
 abnormally via {@link java.util.concurrent.BrokenBarrierException} (or
 {@link InterruptedException} if they too were interrupted at about
 the same time).

 &lt;p&gt;Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to calling
 {@code await()}
 &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 actions that are part of the barrier action, which in turn
 &lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt; actions following a successful return from the
 corresponding {@code await()} in other threads.
