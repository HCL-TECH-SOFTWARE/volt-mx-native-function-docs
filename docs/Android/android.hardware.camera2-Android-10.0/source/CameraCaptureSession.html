</span> implements java.lang.AutoCloseable

@extends java.lang.Object

 A configured capture session for a {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice}, used for capturing images from the
 camera or reprocessing images captured from the camera in the same session previously.

 &lt;p&gt;A CameraCaptureSession is created by providing a set of target output surfaces to
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice#createCaptureSession createCaptureSession}, or by providing an
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.params.InputConfiguration} and a set of target output surfaces to
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice#createReprocessableCaptureSession createReprocessableCaptureSession} for a
 reprocessable capture session. Once created, the session is active until a new session is
 created by the camera device, or the camera device is closed.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All capture sessions can be used for capturing images from the camera but only reprocessable
 capture sessions can reprocess images captured from the camera in the same session previously.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Creating a session is an expensive operation and can take several hundred milliseconds, since
 it requires configuring the camera device's internal pipelines and allocating memory buffers for
 sending images to the desired targets. Therefore the setup is done asynchronously, and
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice#createCaptureSession createCaptureSession} and
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice#createReprocessableCaptureSession createReprocessableCaptureSession} will
 send the ready-to-use CameraCaptureSession to the provided listener's
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onConfigured onConfigured} callback. If configuration
 cannot be completed, then the
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onConfigureFailed onConfigureFailed} is called, and the
 session will not become active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--
 &lt;p&gt;Any capture requests (repeating or non-repeating) submitted before the session is ready will
 be queued up and will begin capture once the session becomes ready. In case the session cannot be
 configured and {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onConfigureFailed onConfigureFailed} is called, all queued
 capture requests are discarded.&lt;/p&gt;
--&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;If a new session is created by the camera device, then the previous session is closed, and its
 associated {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onClosed onClosed} callback will be invoked.  All
 of the session methods will throw an IllegalStateException if called once the session is
 closed.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A closed session clears any repeating requests (as if {@link #stopRepeating} had been called),
 but will still complete all of its in-progress capture requests as normal, before a newly
 created session takes over and reconfigures the camera device.&lt;/p&gt;

</span>
 &lt;p&gt;Normally, the image buffers for a given output Surface are allocated on-demand,
 to minimize startup latency and memory overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;However, in some cases, it may be desirable for the buffers to be allocated before
 any requests targeting the Surface are actually submitted to the device. Large buffers
 may take some time to allocate, which can result in delays in submitting requests until
 sufficient buffers are allocated to reach steady-state behavior. Such delays can cause
 bursts to take longer than desired, or cause skips or stutters in preview output.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The prepare() method can be used to perform this preallocation. It may only be called for
 a given output Surface before that Surface is used as a target for a request. The number of
 buffers allocated is the sum of the count needed by the consumer providing the output
 Surface, and the maximum number needed by the camera device to fill its pipeline. Since this
 may be a larger number than what is actually required for steady-state operation, using
 prepare may result in higher memory consumption than the normal on-demand behavior results
 in. Prepare() will also delay the time to first output to a given Surface, in exchange for
 smoother frame rate once the allocation is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For example, an application that creates an
 {@link android.media.ImageReader#newInstance ImageReader} with a maxImages argument of 10,
 but only uses 3 simultaneous Images at once would normally only cause those 3 images to be
 allocated (plus what is needed by the camera device for smooth operation).  But using
 prepare() on the ImageReader Surface will result in all 10 Images being allocated. So
 applications using this method should take care to request only the number of buffers
 actually necessary for their application.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If the same output Surface is used in consecutive sessions (without closing the first
 session explicitly), then its already-allocated buffers are carried over, and if it was
 used as a target of a capture request in the first session, prepare cannot be called on it
 in the second session.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Once allocation is complete, {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onSurfacePrepared} will be invoked with
 the Surface provided to this method. Between the prepare call and the onSurfacePrepared call,
 the Surface provided to prepare must not be used as a target of a CaptureRequest submitted
 to this session.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Note that if 2 surfaces share the same stream via {@link OutputConfiguration#enableSurfaceSharing} and {@link OutputConfiguration#addSurface},
 prepare() only needs to be called on one surface, and {link
 StateCallback#onSurfacePrepared} will be triggered for both surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;{@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCharacteristics#INFO_SUPPORTED_HARDWARE_LEVEL_LEGACY LEGACY}
 devices cannot pre-allocate output buffers; for those devices,
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onSurfacePrepared} will be immediately called, and no preallocation is
 done.&lt;/p&gt;
@param {Object {Surface}} surface the output Surface for which buffers should be pre-allocated. Must be one of
 the output Surfaces used to create this session.
@throws CameraAccessException if the camera device is no longer connected or has

<span id='android-hardware-camera2-CameraCaptureSession-method-prepare'>/**&lt;p&gt;Pre-allocate at most maxCount buffers for an output Surface.&lt;/p&gt;
</span>
 &lt;p&gt;Like the {@link #prepare}(Surface) method, this method can be used to allocate output
 buffers for a given Surface.  However, while the {@link #prepare}(Surface) method allocates
 the maximum possible buffer count, this method allocates at most maxCount buffers.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If maxCount is greater than the possible maximum count (which is the sum of the buffer
 count requested by the creator of the Surface and the count requested by the camera device),
 only the possible maximum count is allocated, in which case the function acts exactly like
 {@link #prepare}(Surface).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The restrictions on when this method can be called are the same as for
 {@link #prepare}(Surface).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Repeated calls to this method are allowed, and a mix of {@link #prepare}(Surface) and
 this method is also allowed. Note that after the first call to {@link #prepare}(Surface),
 subsequent calls to either prepare method are effectively no-ops.  In addition, this method
 is not additive in terms of buffer count.  This means calling it twice with maxCount = 2
 will only allocate 2 buffers, not 4 (assuming the possible maximum is at least 2); to
 allocate two buffers on the first call and two on the second, the application needs to call
 prepare with prepare(surface, 2) and prepare(surface, 4).&lt;/p&gt;
@param {Number} maxCount the buffer count to try to allocate. If this is greater than the possible
                 maximum for this output, the possible maximum is allocated instead. If
                 maxCount buffers are already allocated, then prepare will do nothing.
@param {Object {Surface}} surface the output Surface for which buffers should be pre-allocated.

                                  or has already been used as a target of a CaptureRequest in

 &lt;p&gt;Normally, once allocated, the image buffers for a given output Surface remain allocated
 for the lifetime of the capture session, to minimize latency of captures and to reduce
 memory allocation overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;However, in some cases, it may be desirable for allocated buffers to be freed to reduce
 the application's memory consumption, if the particular output Surface will not be used by
 the application for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The tearDown() method can be used to perform this operation. After the call finishes, all
 unfilled image buffers will have been freed. Any future use of the target Surface may require
 allocation of additional buffers, as if the session had just been created.  Buffers being
 held by the application (either explicitly as Image objects from ImageReader, or implicitly
 as the current texture in a SurfaceTexture or the current contents of a RS Allocation, will
 remain valid and allocated even when tearDown is invoked.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A Surface that has had tearDown() called on it is eligible to have prepare() invoked on it
 again even if it was used as a request target before the tearDown() call, as long as it
 doesn't get used as a target of a request between the tearDown() and prepare() calls.&lt;/p&gt;

</span> included.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For camera use cases where a preview and other output configurations need to be
 configured, it can take some time for the preview Surface to be ready. For example, if the
 preview Surface is obtained from {@link android.view.SurfaceView}, the SurfaceView will only
 be ready after the UI layout is done, potentially delaying camera startup.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To speed up camera startup time, the application can configure the
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSession} with the eventual preview size (via
 {@link OutputConfiguration#OutputConfiguration(Size,Class) a deferred OutputConfiguration}),
 and defer the preview output configuration until the Surface is ready. After the
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSession} is created successfully with this deferred output and other
 normal outputs, the application can start submitting requests as long as they do not include
 deferred output Surfaces. Once a deferred Surface is ready, the application can add the
 Surface to the deferred output configuration with the
 {@link OutputConfiguration#addSurface} method, and then update the deferred output
 configuration via this method, before it can submit capture requests with this output
 target.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This function can also be called in case where multiple surfaces share the same
 OutputConfiguration, and one of the surfaces becomes available after the {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSession} is created. In that case, the application must first create the
 OutputConfiguration with the available Surface, then enable further surface sharing via
 {@link OutputConfiguration#enableSurfaceSharing}, before creating the CameraCaptureSession.
 After the CameraCaptureSession is created, and once the extra Surface becomes available, the
 application must then call {@link OutputConfiguration#addSurface} before finalizing the
 configuration with this method.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If the provided OutputConfigurations are unchanged from session creation, this function
 call has no effect. This function must only be called once for a particular output
 configuration. &lt;/p&gt;
