</span> of spans.

 MARK and POINT are conceptually located &lt;i&gt;between&lt;/i&gt; two adjacent characters.
 A MARK is &quot;attached&quot; to the character before, while a POINT will stick to the character
 after. The insertion cursor is conceptually located between the MARK and the POINT.

 As a result, inserting a new character between a MARK and a POINT will leave the MARK
 unchanged, while the POINT will be shifted, now located after the inserted character and
 still glued to the same character after it.

 Depending on whether the insertion happens at the beginning or the end of a span, the span
 will hence be expanded to &lt;i&gt;include&lt;/i&gt; the new character (when the span is using a MARK at
 its beginning or a POINT at its end) or it will be &lt;i&gt;excluded&lt;/i&gt;.

 Note that &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; here refer to offsets in the String, which are
 independent from the visual representation of the text (left-to-right or right-to-left).
