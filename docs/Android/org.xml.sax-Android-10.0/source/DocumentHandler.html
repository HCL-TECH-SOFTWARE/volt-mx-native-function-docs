 &lt;em&gt;This module, both source code and documentation, is in the
 Public Domain, and comes with &lt;strong&gt;NO WARRANTY&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This was the main event-handling interface for SAX1; in
 SAX2, it has been replaced by {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler
 ContentHandler}, which provides Namespace support and reporting
 of skipped entities.  This interface is included in SAX2 only
 to support legacy SAX1 applications.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The order of events in this interface is very important, and
 mirrors the order of information in the document itself.  For
 example, all of an element's content (character data, processing
 instructions, and/or subelements) will appear, in order, between
 the startElement event and the corresponding endElement event.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Application writers who do not want to implement the entire
 interface can derive a class from HandlerBase, which implements
 the default functionality; parser writers can instantiate
 HandlerBase to obtain a default handler.  The application can find
 the location of any document event using the Locator interface
 supplied by the Parser through the setDocumentLocator method.&lt;/p&gt;

 @deprecated This interface has been replaced by the SAX2
             {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler ContentHandler}
             interface, which includes Namespace support.

 &lt;p&gt;SAX parsers are strongly encouraged (though not absolutely
 required) to supply a locator: if it does so, it must supply
 the locator to the application by invoking this method before
 invoking any of the other methods in the DocumentHandler
 interface.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The locator allows the application to determine the end
 position of any document-related event, even if the parser is
 not reporting an error.  Typically, the application will
 use this information for reporting its own errors (such as
 character content that does not match an application's
 business rules).  The information returned by the locator
 is probably not sufficient for use with a search engine.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Note that the locator will return correct information only
 during the invocation of the events in this interface.  The
 application should not attempt to use it at any other time.&lt;/p&gt;

 data in a single chunk, or they may split it into several
 chunks; however, all of the characters in any single event
 must come from the same external entity, so that the Locator
 provides useful information.&lt;/p&gt;
