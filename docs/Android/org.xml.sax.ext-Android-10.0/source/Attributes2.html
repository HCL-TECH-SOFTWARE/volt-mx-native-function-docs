</span> implements org.xml.sax.Attributes

 SAX2 extension to augment the per-attribute information
 provided though {@link Attributes}.
 If an implementation supports this extension, the attributes
 provided in {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#startElement
 ContentHandler.startElement() } will implement this interface,
 and the &lt;em&gt;http://xml.org/sax/features/use-attributes2&lt;/em&gt;
 feature flag will have the value &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;.

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;em&gt;This module, both source code and documentation, is in the
 Public Domain, and comes with &lt;strong&gt;NO WARRANTY&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; XMLReader implementations are not required to support this
 information, and it is not part of core-only SAX2 distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Note that if an attribute was defaulted (&lt;em&gt;!isSpecified()&lt;/em&gt;)
 it will of necessity also have been declared (&lt;em&gt;isDeclared()&lt;/em&gt;)
 in the DTD.
 Similarly if an attribute's type is anything except CDATA, then it
 must have been declared.
 &lt;/p&gt;
