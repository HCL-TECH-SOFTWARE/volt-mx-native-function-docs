</span> A &lt;tt&gt;AccountManagerFuture&lt;/tt&gt; represents the result of an asynchronous
 {@link android.accounts.AccountManager} call.  Methods are provided to check if the computation is
 complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of
 the computation.  The result can only be retrieved using method
 &lt;tt&gt;get&lt;/tt&gt; when the computation has completed, blocking if
 necessary until it is ready.  Cancellation is performed by the
 &lt;tt&gt;cancel&lt;/tt&gt; method.  Additional methods are provided to
 determine if the task completed normally or was cancelled. Once a
 computation has completed, the computation cannot be cancelled.
 If you would like to use a &lt;tt&gt;Future&lt;/tt&gt; for the sake
 of cancellability but not provide a usable result, you can
 declare types of the form &lt;tt&gt;Future&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and
 return &lt;tt&gt;null&lt;/tt&gt; as a result of the underlying task.
