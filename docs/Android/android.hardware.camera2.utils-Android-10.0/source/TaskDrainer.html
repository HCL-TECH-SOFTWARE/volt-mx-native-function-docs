 Keep track of multiple concurrent tasks starting and finishing by their key;
 allow draining existing tasks and figuring out when all tasks have finished
 (and new ones won't begin).

 &lt;p&gt;The initial state is to allow all tasks to be started and finished. A task may only be started
 once, after which it must be finished before starting again. Likewise, a task may only be
 finished once, after which it must be started before finishing again. It is okay to finish a
 task before starting it due to different threads handling starting and finishing.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;When draining begins, no more new tasks can be started. This guarantees that at some
 point when all the tasks are finished there will be no more collective new tasks,
 at which point the {@link android.hardware.camera2.utils.TaskDrainer.DrainListener#onDrained} callback will be invoked.&lt;/p&gt;


 @param &lt;T&gt;
          a type for the key that will represent tracked tasks;
          must implement {@code Object#equals}
