@extends java.lang.Object

 Implement a shared/exclusive lock that can be closed.

 &lt;p&gt;A shared lock can be acquired if any other shared locks are also acquired. An
 exclusive lock acquire will block until all shared locks have been released.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Locks are re-entrant; trying to acquire another lock (of the same type)
 while a lock is already held will immediately succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Acquiring to acquire a shared lock while holding an exclusive lock or vice versa is not
 supported; attempting it will throw an {@link IllegalStateException}.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If the lock is closed, all future and current acquires will immediately return {@code null}.
 &lt;/p&gt;
