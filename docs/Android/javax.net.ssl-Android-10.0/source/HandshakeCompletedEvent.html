 This event indicates that an SSL handshake completed on a given
 SSL connection.  All of the core information about that handshake's
 result is captured through an &quot;SSLSession&quot; object.  As a convenience,
 this event class provides direct access to some important session
 attributes.

 &lt;P&gt; The source of this event is the SSLSocket on which handshaking
 just completed.
