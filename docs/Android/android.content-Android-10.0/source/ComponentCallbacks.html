 any caches or other unnecessary resources you may be holding on to.

 {@link android.content.ComponentCallbacks2} to incrementally unload your resources based on various
 levels of memory demands.  That API is available for API level 14 and higher, so you should
 only use this {@link #onLowMemory} method as a fallback for older versions, which can be
 treated the same as {@link android.content.ComponentCallbacks2#onTrimMemory} with the {@link android.content.ComponentCallbacks2#TRIM_MEMORY_COMPLETE} level.&lt;/p&gt;
