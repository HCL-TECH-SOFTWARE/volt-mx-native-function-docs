</span> implements android.os.Parcelable

@extends java.lang.Object

 A description of an Intent and target action to perform with it.
 The returned object can be
 handed to other applications so that they can perform the action you
 described on your behalf at a later time.

 &lt;p&gt;By giving a IntentSender to another application,
 you are granting it the right to perform the operation you have specified
 as if the other application was yourself (with the same permissions and
 identity).  As such, you should be careful about how you build the IntentSender:
 often, for example, the base Intent you supply will have the component
 name explicitly set to one of your own components, to ensure it is ultimately
 sent there and nowhere else.

 &lt;p&gt;A IntentSender itself is simply a reference to a token maintained by
 the system describing the original data used to retrieve it.  This means
 that, even if its owning application's process is killed, the
 IntentSender itself will remain usable from other processes that
 have been given it.  If the creating application later re-retrieves the
 same kind of IntentSender (same operation, same Intent action, data,
 categories, and components, and same flags), it will receive a IntentSender
 representing the same token if that is still valid.

 &lt;p&gt;Instances of this class can not be made directly, but rather must be
 created from an existing {@link android.app.PendingIntent} with
 {@link android.app.PendingIntent#getIntentSender() PendingIntent.getIntentSender()}.
