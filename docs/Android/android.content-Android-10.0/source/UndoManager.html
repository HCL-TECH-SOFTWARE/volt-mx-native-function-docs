</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Top-level class for managing and interacting with the global undo state for
 a document or application.  This class supports both undo and redo and has
 helpers for merging undoable operations together as they are performed.

 &lt;p&gt;A single undoable operation is represented by {@link android.content.UndoOperation} which
 apps implement to define their undo/redo behavior.  The UndoManager keeps
 a stack of undo states; each state can have one or more undo operations
 inside of it.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Updates to the stack must be done inside of a {@link #beginUpdate}/{@link #endUpdate}()
 pair.  During this time you can add new operations to the stack with
 {@link #addOperation}, retrieve and modify existing operations with
 {@link #getLastOperation}, control the label shown to the user for this operation
 with {@link #setUndoLabel} and {@link #suggestUndoLabel}, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Every {link UndoOperation} is associated with an {@link android.content.UndoOwner}, which identifies
 the data it belongs to.  The owner is used to indicate how operations are dependent
 on each other -- operations with the same owner are dependent on others with the
 same owner.  For example, you may have a document with multiple embedded objects.  If the
 document itself and each embedded object use different owners, then you
 can provide undo semantics appropriate to the user's context: while within
 an embedded object, only edits to that object are seen and the user can
 undo/redo them without needing to impact edits in other objects; while
 within the larger document, all edits can be seen and the user must
 undo/redo them as a single stream.&lt;/p&gt;
