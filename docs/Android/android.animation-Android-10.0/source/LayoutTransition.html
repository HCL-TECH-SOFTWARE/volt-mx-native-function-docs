</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 This class enables automatic animations on layout changes in ViewGroup objects. To enable
 transitions for a layout container, create a LayoutTransition object and set it on any
 ViewGroup by calling {@link ViewGroup#setLayoutTransition(LayoutTransition)}. This will cause
 default animations to run whenever items are added to or removed from that container. To specify
 custom animations, use the {@link android.animation.LayoutTransition#setAnimator(int, Animator)
 setAnimator()} method.

 &lt;p&gt;One of the core concepts of these transition animations is that there are two types of
 changes that cause the transition and four different animations that run because of
 those changes. The changes that trigger the transition are items being added to a container
 (referred to as an &quot;appearing&quot; transition) or removed from a container (also known as
 &quot;disappearing&quot;). Setting the visibility of views (between GONE and VISIBLE) will trigger
 the same add/remove logic. The animations that run due to those events are one that animates
 items being added, one that animates items being removed, and two that animate the other
 items in the container that change due to the add/remove occurrence. Users of
 the transition may want different animations for the changing items depending on whether
 they are changing due to an appearing or disappearing event, so there is one animation for
 each of these variations of the changing event. Most of the API of this class is concerned
 with setting up the basic properties of the animations used in these four situations,
 or with setting up custom animations for any or all of the four.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;By default, the DISAPPEARING animation begins immediately, as does the CHANGE_APPEARING
 animation. The other animations begin after a delay that is set to the default duration
 of the animations. This behavior facilitates a sequence of animations in transitions as
 follows: when an item is being added to a layout, the other children of that container will
 move first (thus creating space for the new item), then the appearing animation will run to
 animate the item being added. Conversely, when an item is removed from a container, the
 animation to remove it will run first, then the animations of the other children in the
 layout will run (closing the gap created in the layout when the item was removed). If this
 default choreography behavior is not desired, the {@link #setDuration(int, long)} and
 {@link #setStartDelay(int, long)} of any or all of the animations can be changed as
 appropriate. Keep in mind, however, that if you start an APPEARING animation before a
 DISAPPEARING animation is completed, the DISAPPEARING animation stops, and any effects from
 the DISAPPEARING animation are reverted. If you instead start a DISAPPEARING animation
 before an APPEARING animation is completed, a similar set of effects occurs for the
 APPEARING animation.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The animations specified for the transition, both the defaults and any custom animations
 set on the transition object, are templates only. That is, these animations exist to hold the
 basic animation properties, such as the duration, start delay, and properties being animated.
 But the actual target object, as well as the start and end values for those properties, are
 set automatically in the process of setting up the transition each time it runs. Each of the
 animations is cloned from the original copy and the clone is then populated with the dynamic
 values of the target being animated (such as one of the items in a layout container that is
 moving as a result of the layout event) as well as the values that are changing (such as the
 position and size of that object). The actual values that are pushed to each animation
 depends on what properties are specified for the animation. For example, the default
 CHANGE_APPEARING animation animates the &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;,
 &lt;code&gt;bottom&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;scrollX&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;scrollY&lt;/code&gt; properties.
 Values for these properties are updated with the pre- and post-layout
 values when the transition begins. Custom animations will be similarly populated with
 the target and values being animated, assuming they use ObjectAnimator objects with
 property names that are known on the target object.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This class, and the associated XML flag for containers, animateLayoutChanges=&quot;true&quot;,
 provides a simple utility meant for automating changes in straightforward situations.
 Using LayoutTransition at multiple levels of a nested view hierarchy may not work due to the
 interrelationship of the various levels of layout. Also, a container that is being scrolled
 at the same time as items are being added or removed is probably not a good candidate for
 this utility, because the before/after locations calculated by LayoutTransition
 may not match the actual locations when the animations finish due to the container
 being scrolled as the animations are running. You can work around that
 particular issue by disabling the 'changing' animations by setting the CHANGE_APPEARING
 and CHANGE_DISAPPEARING animations to null, and setting the startDelay of the
 other animations appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

 transitions, the animation should either be a ObjectAnimator or a AnimatorSet
 of animations including PropertyAnimators. Also, these ObjectAnimator objects
 should be able to get and set values on their target objects automatically. For
 example, a ObjectAnimator that animates the property &quot;left&quot; is able to set and get the
 &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; property from the View objects being animated by the layout
 transition. The transition works by setting target objects and properties
 dynamically, according to the pre- and post-layoout values of those objects, so
 having animations that can handle those properties appropriately will work best
 for custom animation. The dynamic setting of values is only the case for the
 CHANGE animations; the APPEARING and DISAPPEARING animations are simply run with
 the values they have.

 &lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that any and all animations (and their underlying
 PropertyValuesHolder objects) will have their start and end values set according
 to the pre- and post-layout values. So, for example, a custom animation on &quot;alpha&quot;
 as the CHANGE_APPEARING animation will inherit the real value of alpha on the target
 object (presumably 1) as its starting and ending value when the animation begins.
 Animations which need to use values at the beginning and end that may not match the
 values queried when the transition begins may need to use a different mechanism
