 Implements heuristics to detect docking or undocking from a wireless charger.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Some devices have wireless charging circuits that are unable to detect when the
 device is resting on a wireless charger except when the device is actually
 receiving power from the charger.  The device may stop receiving power
 if the battery is already nearly full or if it is too hot.  As a result, we cannot
 always rely on the battery service wireless plug signal to accurately indicate
 whether the device has been docked or undocked from a wireless charger.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 This is a problem because the power manager typically wakes up the screen and
 plays a tone when the device is docked in a wireless charger.  It is important
 for the system to suppress spurious docking and undocking signals because they
 can be intrusive for the user (especially if they cause a tone to be played
 late at night for no apparent reason).
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 To avoid spurious signals, we apply some special policies to wireless chargers.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 1. Don't wake the device when undocked from the wireless charger because
 it might be that the device is still resting on the wireless charger
 but is not receiving power anymore because the battery is full.
 Ideally we would wake the device if we could be certain that the user had
 picked it up from the wireless charger but due to hardware limitations we
 must be more conservative.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 2. Don't wake the device when docked on a wireless charger if the
 battery already appears to be mostly full.  This situation may indicate
 that the device was resting on the charger the whole time and simply
 wasn't receiving power because the battery was already full.  We can't tell
 whether the device was just placed on the charger or whether it has
 been there for half of the night slowly discharging until it reached
 the point where it needed to start charging again.  So we suppress docking
 signals that occur when the battery level is above a given threshold.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 3. Don't wake the device when docked on a wireless charger if it does
 not appear to have moved since it was last undocked because it may
 be that the prior undocking signal was spurious.  We use the gravity
 sensor to detect this case.
 &lt;/p&gt;
