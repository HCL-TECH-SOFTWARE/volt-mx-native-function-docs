</span> Observe activity manager launch sequences.

 The activity manager can have at most 1 concurrent launch sequences. Calls to this interface
 are ordered by a happens-before relation for each defined state transition (see below).

 When a new launch sequence is made, that sequence is in the {@code INTENT_STARTED} state which
 is communicated by the {@link #onIntentStarted} callback. This is a transient state.

 The intent can fail to launch the activity, in which case the sequence's state transitions to
 {@code INTENT_FAILED} via {@link #onIntentFailed}. This is a terminal state.

 If an activity is successfully started, the launch sequence's state will transition into
 {@code STARTED} via {@link #onActivityLaunched}. This is a transient state.

 It must then transition to either {@code CANCELLED} with {@link #onActivityLaunchCancelled}
 or into {@code FINISHED} with {@link #onActivityLaunchFinished}. These are terminal states.

 Note that the {@code ActivityRecordProto} provided as a parameter to some state transitions isn't
 necessarily the same within a single launch sequence: it is only the top-most activity at the
 time (if any). Trampoline activities coalesce several activity starts into a single launch
 sequence.

 Upon reaching a terminal state, it is considered that there are no active launch sequences
 until a subsequent transition into {@code INTENT_STARTED} initiates a new launch sequence.

 This is an intermediate state: once an activity begins starting, the entire launch sequence
 will later terminate by either finishing or cancelling.

 The initial activity is the first activity to be started as part of a launch sequence:
 it is represented by {@param activity} However, it isn't
 necessarily the activity which will be considered as displayed when the activity
 finishes launching (e.g. {@code activity} in {@link #onActivityLaunchFinished}).

 This function call terminates the current launch sequence. The next method call, if any,

 This can happen for many reasons, for example the user switches away to another app
 prior to the launch sequence completing, or the application being killed.
