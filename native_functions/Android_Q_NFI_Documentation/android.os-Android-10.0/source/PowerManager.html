</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 This class gives you control of the power state of the device.

 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Device battery life will be significantly affected by the use of this API.&lt;/b&gt;
 Do not acquire {@link android.os.PowerManager.WakeLock}s unless you really need them, use the minimum levels
 possible, and be sure to release them as soon as possible.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 The primary API you'll use is {@link #newWakeLock(int, String) newWakeLock()}.
 This will create a {@link android.os.PowerManager.WakeLock} object.  You can then use methods
 on the wake lock object to control the power state of the device.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 In practice it's quite simple:
 {@samplecode
 PowerManager pm = (PowerManager) getSystemService(Context.POWER_SERVICE);
 PowerManager.WakeLock wl = pm.newWakeLock(PowerManager.SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK, &quot;My Tag&quot;);
 wl.acquire();
   ..screen will stay on during this section..
 wl.release();
 }
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 The following wake lock levels are defined, with varying effects on system power.
 &lt;i&gt;These levels are mutually exclusive - you may only specify one of them.&lt;/i&gt;

 &lt;table&gt;
     &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Flag Value&lt;/th&gt;
     &lt;th&gt;CPU&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Screen&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Keyboard&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

     &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;{@link #PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK}&lt;/td&gt;
         &lt;td&gt;On*&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Off&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Off&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;/tr&gt;

     &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;{@link #SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK}&lt;/td&gt;
         &lt;td&gt;On&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Dim&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Off&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;/tr&gt;

     &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;{@link #SCREEN_BRIGHT_WAKE_LOCK}&lt;/td&gt;
         &lt;td&gt;On&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Bright&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Off&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;/tr&gt;

     &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;{@link #FULL_WAKE_LOCK}&lt;/td&gt;
         &lt;td&gt;On&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Bright&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Bright&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 *&lt;i&gt;If you hold a partial wake lock, the CPU will continue to run, regardless of any
 display timeouts or the state of the screen and even after the user presses the power button.
 In all other wake locks, the CPU will run, but the user can still put the device to sleep
 using the power button.&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 In addition, you can add two more flags, which affect behavior of the screen only.
 &lt;i&gt;These flags have no effect when combined with a {@link #PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK}.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;table&gt;
     &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Flag Value&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

     &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;{@link #ACQUIRE_CAUSES_WAKEUP}&lt;/td&gt;
         &lt;td&gt;Normal wake locks don't actually turn on the illumination.  Instead, they cause
         the illumination to remain on once it turns on (e.g. from user activity).  This flag
         will force the screen and/or keyboard to turn on immediately, when the WakeLock is
         acquired.  A typical use would be for notifications which are important for the user to
         see immediately.&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;/tr&gt;

     &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;{@link #ON_AFTER_RELEASE}&lt;/td&gt;
         &lt;td&gt;If this flag is set, the user activity timer will be reset when the WakeLock is
         released, causing the illumination to remain on a bit longer.  This can be used to
         reduce flicker if you are cycling between wake lock conditions.&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 Any application using a WakeLock must request the {@code android.permission.WAKE_LOCK}
 permission in an {@code &lt;uses-permission&gt;} element of the application's manifest.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 The {@code levelAndFlags} parameter specifies a wake lock level and optional flags

 The wake lock levels are: {@link #PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK},
 {@link #FULL_WAKE_LOCK}, {@link #SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK}
 and {@link #SCREEN_BRIGHT_WAKE_LOCK}.  Exactly one wake lock level must be
 specified as part of the {@code levelAndFlags} parameter.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 The wake lock flags are: {@link #ACQUIRE_CAUSES_WAKEUP}
 and {@link #ON_AFTER_RELEASE}.  Multiple flags can be combined as part of the
 {@code levelAndFlags} parameters.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 Call {@link android.os.PowerManager.WakeLock#acquire() acquire()} on the object to acquire the
 wake lock, and {@link android.os.PowerManager.WakeLock#release release()} when you are done.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 {@samplecode
 PowerManager pm = (PowerManager)mContext.getSystemService(
                                          Context.POWER_SERVICE);

 wl.acquire();
 // ... do work...
 wl.release();
 }
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 Although a wake lock can be created without special permissions,
 the {@link android.Manifest.permission#WAKE_LOCK} permission is
 required to actually acquire or release the wake lock that is returned.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;
 If using this to keep the screen on, you should strongly consider using
 {@link android.view.WindowManager.LayoutParams#FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON} instead.
 This window flag will be correctly managed by the platform
 as the user moves between applications and doesn't require a special permission.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 Recommended naming conventions for tags to make debugging easier:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;use a unique prefix delimited by a colon for your app/library (e.g.
 gmail:mytag) to make it easier to understand where the wake locks comes
 from. This namespace will also avoid collision for tags inside your app
 coming from different libraries which will make debugging easier.
 &lt;li&gt;use constants (e.g. do not include timestamps in the tag) to make it
 easier for tools to aggregate similar wake locks. When collecting
 debugging data, the platform only monitors a finite number of tags,
 using constants will help tools to provide better debugging data.
 &lt;li&gt;avoid using Class#getName() or similar method since this class name
 can be transformed by java optimizer and obfuscator tools.
 &lt;li&gt;avoid wrapping the tag or a prefix to avoid collision with wake lock
 tags from the platform (e.g. *alarm*).
 &lt;li&gt;never include personnally identifiable information for privacy
 reasons.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
