</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Takes care of the grunt work of maintaining a list of remote interfaces,
 typically for the use of performing callbacks from a
 {@link android.app.Service} to its clients.  In particular, this:

 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; Keeps track of a set of registered {@link android.os.IInterface} callbacks,
 taking care to identify them through their underlying unique {@link android.os.IBinder}
 (by calling {@link android.os.IInterface#asBinder android.os.IInterface.asBinder()}.
 &lt;li&gt; Attaches a {@link android.os.IBinder.DeathRecipient android.os.IBinder.DeathRecipient} to
 each registered interface, so that it can be cleaned out of the list if its
 process goes away.
 &lt;li&gt; Performs locking of the underlying list of interfaces to deal with
 multithreaded incoming calls, and a thread-safe way to iterate over a
 snapshot of the list without holding its lock.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To use this class, simply create a single instance along with your
 service, and call its {@link #register} and {@link #unregister} methods
 as client register and unregister with your service.  To call back on to
 the registered clients, use {@link #beginBroadcast},
 {@link #getBroadcastItem}, and {@link #finishBroadcast}.

 &lt;p&gt;If a registered callback's process goes away, this class will take
 care of automatically removing it from the list.  If you want to do
 additional work in this situation, you can create a subclass that
 implements the {@link #onCallbackDied} method.
