 Core timekeeping facilities.

 &lt;p&gt; Three different clocks are available, and they should not be confused:

 &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; {@link System#currentTimeMillis System.currentTimeMillis()}
     is the standard &quot;wall&quot; clock (time and date) expressing milliseconds
     since the epoch.  The wall clock can be set by the user or the phone
     network (see {@link #setCurrentTimeMillis}), so the time may jump
     backwards or forwards unpredictably.  This clock should only be used
     when correspondence with real-world dates and times is important, such
     as in a calendar or alarm clock application.  Interval or elapsed
     time measurements should use a different clock.  If you are using
     System.currentTimeMillis(), consider listening to the
     {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_TIME_TICK ACTION_TIME_TICK},
     {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_TIME_CHANGED ACTION_TIME_CHANGED}
     and {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_TIMEZONE_CHANGED
     ACTION_TIMEZONE_CHANGED} {@link android.content.Intent Intent}
     broadcasts to find out when the time changes.

     &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; {@link #uptimeMillis} is counted in milliseconds since the
     system was booted.  This clock stops when the system enters deep
     sleep (CPU off, display dark, device waiting for external input),
     but is not affected by clock scaling, idle, or other power saving
     mechanisms.  This is the basis for most interval timing
     such as {@link Thread#sleep(long) Thread.sleep(millls)},
     {@link Object#wait(long) Object.wait(millis)}, and
     {@link System#nanoTime System.nanoTime()}.  This clock is guaranteed
     to be monotonic, and is suitable for interval timing when the
     interval does not span device sleep.  Most methods that accept a
     timestamp value currently expect the {@link #uptimeMillis} clock.

     &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; {@link #elapsedRealtime} and {@link #elapsedRealtimeNanos}
     return the time since the system was booted, and include deep sleep.
     This clock is guaranteed to be monotonic, and continues to tick even
     when the CPU is in power saving modes, so is the recommend basis
     for general purpose interval timing.

 &lt;/ul&gt;

 There are several mechanisms for controlling the timing of events:

 &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; Standard functions like {@link Thread#sleep(long)
     Thread.sleep(millis)} and {@link Object#wait(long) Object.wait(millis)}
     are always available.  These functions use the {@link #uptimeMillis}
     clock; if the device enters sleep, the remainder of the time will be
     postponed until the device wakes up.  These synchronous functions may
     be interrupted with {@link Thread#interrupt Thread.interrupt()}, and
     you must handle {@link InterruptedException}.

     &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; {@link #sleep android.os.SystemClock.sleep(millis)} is a utility function
     very similar to {@link Thread#sleep(long) Thread.sleep(millis)}, but it
     ignores {@link InterruptedException}.  Use this function for delays if
     you do not use {@link Thread#interrupt Thread.interrupt()}, as it will
     preserve the interrupted state of the thread.

     &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; The {@link android.os.Handler} class can schedule asynchronous
     callbacks at an absolute or relative time.  Handler objects also use the
     {@link #uptimeMillis} clock, and require an {@link android.os.Looper
     event loop} (normally present in any GUI application).

     &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; The {@link android.app.AlarmManager} can trigger one-time or
     recurring events which occur even when the device is in deep sleep
     or your application is not running.  Events may be scheduled with your
     choice of {@link java.lang.System#currentTimeMillis} (RTC) or
     {@link #elapsedRealtime} (ELAPSED_REALTIME), and cause an
     {@link android.content.Intent} broadcast when they occur.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
