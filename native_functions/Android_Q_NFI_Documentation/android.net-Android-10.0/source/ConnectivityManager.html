</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Class that answers queries about the state of network connectivity. It also
 notifies applications when network connectivity changes.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The primary responsibilities of this class are to:
 &lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Monitor network connections (Wi-Fi, GPRS, UMTS, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Send broadcast intents when network connectivity changes&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Attempt to &quot;fail over&quot; to another network when connectivity to a network
 is lost&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Provide an API that allows applications to query the coarse-grained or fine-grained
 state of the available networks&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Provide an API that allows applications to request and select networks for their data
 traffic&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;

<span id='android-net-ConnectivityManager-property-CONNECTIVITY_ACTION'>/** A change in network connectivity has occurred. A default connection has either
</span> been established or lost. The NetworkInfo for the affected network is
 sent as an extra; it should be consulted to see what kind of
 connectivity event occurred.
 &lt;p/&gt;
 Apps targeting Android 7.0 (API level 24) and higher do not receive this
 broadcast if they declare the broadcast receiver in their manifest. Apps
 will still receive broadcasts if they register their
 {@link android.content.BroadcastReceiver} with
 {@link android.content.Context#registerReceiver Context.registerReceiver()}
 and that context is still valid.
 &lt;p/&gt;
 If this is a connection that was the result of failing over from a
 disconnected network, then the FAILOVER_CONNECTION boolean extra is
 set to true.
 &lt;p/&gt;
 For a loss of connectivity, if the connectivity manager is attempting
 to connect (or has already connected) to another network, the
 NetworkInfo for the new network is also passed as an extra. This lets
 any receivers of the broadcast know that they should not necessarily
 tell the user that no data traffic will be possible. Instead, the
 receiver should expect another broadcast soon, indicating either that
 the failover attempt succeeded (and so there is still overall data
 connectivity), or that the failover attempt failed, meaning that all
 connectivity has been lost.
 &lt;p/&gt;
 For a disconnect event, the boolean extra EXTRA_NO_CONNECTIVITY
 is set to {@code true} if there are no connected networks at all.

 @deprecated apps should use the more versatile {@link #requestNetwork},
             {@link #registerNetworkCallback} or {@link #registerDefaultNetworkCallback}
             functions instead for faster and more detailed updates about the network
             changes they care about.
