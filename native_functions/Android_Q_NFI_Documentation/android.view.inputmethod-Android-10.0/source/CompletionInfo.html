</span> implements android.os.Parcelable

@extends java.lang.Object

 Information about a single text completion that an editor has reported to
 an input method.

 &lt;p&gt;This class encapsulates a completion offered by an application
 that wants it to be presented to the user by the IME. Usually, apps
 present their completions directly in a scrolling list for example
 (UI developers will usually use or extend
 {@see android.widget.AutoCompleteTextView} to implement this).
 However, in some cases, the editor may not be visible, as in the
 case in extract mode where the IME has taken over the full
 screen. In this case, the editor can choose to send their
 completions to the IME for display.

 &lt;p&gt;Most applications who want to send completions to an IME should use
 {@link android.widget.AutoCompleteTextView} as this class makes this
 process easy. In this case, the application would not have to deal directly
 with this class.

 &lt;p&gt;An application who implements its own editor and wants direct control
 over this would create an array of CompletionInfo objects, and send it to the IME using
 {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputMethodManager#displayCompletions(View, CompletionInfo[])}.
 The IME would present the completions however they see fit, and
 call back to the editor through
 {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputConnection#commitCompletion(CompletionInfo)}.
 The application can then pick up the commit event by overriding
 {@link android.widget.TextView#onCommitCompletion(CompletionInfo)}.
