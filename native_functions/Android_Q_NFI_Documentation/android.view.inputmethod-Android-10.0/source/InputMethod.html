</span> The InputMethod interface represents an input method which can generate key
 events and text, such as digital, email addresses, CJK characters, other
 language characters, and etc., while handling various input events, and send
 the text back to the application that requests text input.  See
 {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputMethodManager} for more general information about the
 architecture.

 &lt;p&gt;Applications will not normally use this interface themselves, instead
 relying on the standard interaction provided by
 {@link android.widget.TextView} and {@link android.widget.EditText}.
 
 &lt;p&gt;Those implementing input methods should normally do so by deriving from
 {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputMethodService} or one of its subclasses.  When implementing
 an input method, the service component containing it must also supply
 a {@link #SERVICE_META_DATA} meta-data field, referencing an XML resource
 providing details about the input method.  All input methods also must
 require that clients hold the
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_INPUT_METHOD} in order to interact
 with the service; if this is not required, the system will not use that
 input method, because it can not trust that it is not compromised.
 
 &lt;p&gt;The InputMethod interface is actually split into two parts: the interface
 here is the top-level interface to the input method, providing all
 access to it, which only the system can access (due to the BIND_INPUT_METHOD
 permission requirement).  In addition its method
 {@link #createSession(android.view.inputmethod.InputMethod.SessionCallback)}
 can be called to instantate a secondary {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputMethodSession} interface
 which is what clients use to communicate with the input method.
