</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Wrapper for {@link InputStream} that allows you to read bytes from it like a byte[]. An
 internal buffer is kept as small as possible to avoid large unnecessary allocations.

 &lt;p/&gt;
 Care must be taken so that the internal buffer is kept small. The best practice is to
 precalculate the maximum buffer size that you will need. For example,
 say you have a loop that reads bytes from index &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;,
 skips to index &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;, reads from index &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;N+10&lt;/code&gt;, etc. Then
 you know that the internal buffer can have a maximum size of &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;,
 and you should set the &lt;code&gt;bufferSize&lt;/code&gt; parameter to &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; in the constructor.

 &lt;p/&gt;
 Use {@link #advanceTo}(int) to declare that you will not need to access lesser indexes. This
 helps to keep the internal buffer small. In the above example, after reading bytes from index
 &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;, you should call &lt;code&gt;advanceTo(N)&lt;/code&gt; so that internal
 buffer becomes filled with bytes from index &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;N+10&lt;/code&gt;.

 &lt;p/&gt;
 If you know that you are reading bytes from a &lt;strong&gt;strictly&lt;/strong&gt; increasing or equal
 index, then you should set the &lt;code&gt;autoAdvance&lt;/code&gt; parameter to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in the
 constructor. For complicated access patterns, or when you prefer to control the internal
 buffer yourself, set &lt;code&gt;autoAdvance&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. When
 &lt;code&gt;autoAdvance&lt;/code&gt; is enabled, every time an index is beyond the buffer length,
 the buffer will be shifted forward such that the index requested becomes the first element in
 the buffer.

 &lt;p/&gt;
 All public methods with parameter &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; are absolute indexed. The index is from
 the beginning of the wrapped input stream.

 If the index is not in the internal buffer, but it can be requested from the input stream,
 {@link #fill}(int) will be called first, and the byte at the index returned.

 exceptions will be thrown as described above.
