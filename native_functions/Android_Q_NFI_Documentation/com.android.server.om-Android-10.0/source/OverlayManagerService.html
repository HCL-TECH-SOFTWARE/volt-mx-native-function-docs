 Service to manage asset overlays.

 &lt;p&gt;Asset overlays are additional resources that come from apks loaded
 alongside the system and app apks. This service, the OverlayManagerService
 (OMS), tracks which installed overlays to use and provides methods to change
 this. Changes propagate to running applications as part of the Activity
 lifecycle. This allows Activities to reread their resources at a well
 defined point.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;By itself, the OMS will not change what overlays should be active.
 Instead, it is only responsible for making sure that overlays *can* be used
 from a technical and security point of view and to activate overlays in
 response to external requests. The responsibility to toggle overlays on and
 off lies within components that implement different use-cases such as themes
 or dynamic customization.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The OMS receives input from three sources:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Callbacks from the SystemService class, specifically when the
     Android framework is booting and when the end user switches Android
     users.&lt;/li&gt;

     &lt;li&gt;Intents from the PackageManagerService (PMS). Overlays are regular
     apks, and whenever a package is installed (or removed, or has a
     component enabled or disabled), the PMS broadcasts this as an intent.
     When the OMS receives one of these intents, it updates its internal
     representation of the available overlays and, if there was a visible
     change, triggers an asset refresh in the affected apps.&lt;/li&gt;

     &lt;li&gt;External requests via the {@link IOverlayManager AIDL interface}.
     The interface allows clients to read information about the currently
     available overlays, change whether an overlay should be used or not, and
     change the relative order in which overlay packages are loaded.
     Read-access is granted if the request targets the same Android user as
     the caller runs as, or if the caller holds the
     INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL permission. Write-access is granted if the
     caller is granted read-access and additionaly holds the
     CHANGE_OVERLAY_PACKAGES permission.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The AIDL interface works with String package names, int user IDs, and
 {@link OverlayInfo} objects. OverlayInfo instances are used to track a
 specific pair of target and overlay packages and include information such as
 the current state of the overlay. OverlayInfo objects are immutable.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Internally, OverlayInfo objects are maintained by the
 OverlayManagerSettings class. The OMS and its helper classes are notified of
 changes to the settings by the OverlayManagerSettings.ChangeListener
 callback interface. The file /data/system/overlays.xml is used to persist
 the settings.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Creation and deletion of idmap files are handled by the IdmapManager
 class.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The following is an overview of OMS and its related classes. Note how box
 (2) does the heavy lifting, box (1) interacts with the Android framework,
 and box (3) replaces box (1) during unit testing.&lt;/p&gt;

     . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
 &lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To test the OMS, execute:
 &lt;code&gt;
 atest FrameworksServicesTests:com.android.server.om  # internal tests
 atest OverlayDeviceTests OverlayHostTests            # public API tests
 &lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Finally, here is a list of keywords used in the OMS context.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;target [package]&lt;/b&gt; -- A regular apk that may have its resource
     pool extended  by zero or more overlay packages.&lt;/li&gt;

     &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;overlay [package]&lt;/b&gt; -- An apk that provides additional
     resources to another apk.&lt;/li&gt;

     &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;OMS&lt;/b&gt; -- The OverlayManagerService, i.e. this class.&lt;/li&gt;

     &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;approved&lt;/b&gt; -- An overlay is approved if the OMS has verified
     that it can be used technically speaking (its target package is
     installed, at least one resource name in both packages match, the
     idmap was created, etc) and that it is secure to do so. External
     clients can not change this state.&lt;/li&gt;

     &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;not approved&lt;/b&gt; -- The opposite of approved.&lt;/li&gt;

     &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;enabled&lt;/b&gt; -- An overlay currently in active use and thus part
     of resource lookups. This requires the overlay to be approved. Only
     external clients can change this state.&lt;/li&gt;

     &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;disabled&lt;/b&gt; -- The opposite of enabled.&lt;/li&gt;

     &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;idmap&lt;/b&gt; -- A mapping of resource IDs between target and overlay
     used during resource lookup. Also the name of the binary that creates
     the mapping.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
