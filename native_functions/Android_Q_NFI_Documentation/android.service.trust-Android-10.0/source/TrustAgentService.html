</span>@extends android.app.Service

 A service that notifies the system about whether it believes the environment of the device
 to be trusted.

 &lt;p&gt;Trust agents may only be provided by the platform. It is expected that there is only
 one trust agent installed on the platform. In the event there is more than one,
 either trust agent can enable trust.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To extend this class, you must declare the service in your manifest file with
 the {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_TRUST_AGENT} permission
 and include an intent filter with the {@link #SERVICE_INTERFACE} action. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;pre&gt;
 &amp;lt;service android:name=&quot;.TrustAgent&quot;
          android:label=&quot;&amp;#64;string/service_name&quot;
          android:permission=&quot;android.permission.BIND_TRUST_AGENT&quot;&gt;
     &amp;lt;intent-filter&gt;
         &amp;lt;action android:name=&quot;android.service.trust.TrustAgentService&quot; /&gt;
     &amp;lt;/intent-filter&gt;
     &amp;lt;meta-data android:name=&quot;android.service.trust.trustagent&quot;
          android:value=&quot;&amp;#64;xml/trust_agent&quot; /&gt;
 &amp;lt;/service&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The associated meta-data file can specify an activity that is accessible through Settings
 and should allow configuring the trust agent, as defined in
 {@link android.R.styleable#TrustAgent}. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;pre&gt;
 &amp;lt;trust-agent xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;
          android:settingsActivity=&quot;.TrustAgentSettings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
