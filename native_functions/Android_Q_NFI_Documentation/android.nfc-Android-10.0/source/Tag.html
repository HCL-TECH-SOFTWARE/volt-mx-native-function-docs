</span> implements android.os.Parcelable

@extends java.lang.Object

 Represents an NFC tag that has been discovered.
 &lt;p&gt;
 {@link android.nfc.Tag} is an immutable object that represents the state of a NFC tag at
 the time of discovery. It can be used as a handle to {@link android.nfc.TagTechnology} classes
 to perform advanced operations, or directly queried for its ID via {@link #getId} and the
 set of technologies it contains via {@link #getTechList}. Arrays passed to and
 returned by this class are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; cloned, so be careful not to modify them.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A new tag object is created every time a tag is discovered (comes into range), even
 if it is the same physical tag. If a tag is removed and then returned into range, then
 only the most recent tag object can be successfully used to create a {@link android.nfc.TagTechnology}.

 &lt;h3&gt;Tag Dispatch&lt;/h3&gt;
 When a tag is discovered, a {@link android.nfc.Tag} object is created and passed to a
 single activity via the {@link android.nfc.NfcAdapter#EXTRA_TAG} extra in an
 {@link android.content.Intent} via {@link Context#startActivity}. A four stage dispatch is used
 to select the
 most appropriate activity to handle the tag. The Android OS executes each stage in order,
 and completes dispatch as soon as a single matching activity is found. If there are multiple
 matching activities found at any one stage then the Android activity chooser dialog is shown
 to allow the user to select the activity to receive the tag.

 &lt;p&gt;The Tag dispatch mechanism was designed to give a high probability of dispatching
 a tag to the correct activity without showing the user an activity chooser dialog.
 This is important for NFC interactions because they are very transient -- if a user has to
 move the Android device to choose an application then the connection will likely be broken.

 &lt;h4&gt;1. Foreground activity dispatch&lt;/h4&gt;
 A foreground activity that has called
 {@link android.nfc.NfcAdapter#enableForegroundDispatch android.nfc.NfcAdapter.enableForegroundDispatch()} is
 given priority. See the documentation on
 {@link android.nfc.NfcAdapter#enableForegroundDispatch android.nfc.NfcAdapter.enableForegroundDispatch()} for
 its usage.
 &lt;h4&gt;2. NDEF data dispatch&lt;/h4&gt;
 If the tag contains NDEF data the system inspects the first {@link android.nfc.NdefRecord} in the first
 {@link android.nfc.NdefMessage}. If the record is a URI, SmartPoster, or MIME data
 {@link Context#startActivity} is called with {@link android.nfc.NfcAdapter#ACTION_NDEF_DISCOVERED}. For URI
 and SmartPoster records the URI is put into the intent's data field. For MIME records the MIME
 type is put in the intent's type field. This allows activities to register to be launched only
 when data they know how to handle is present on a tag. This is the preferred method of handling
 data on a tag since NDEF data can be stored on many types of tags and doesn't depend on a
 specific tag technology. 
 See {@link android.nfc.NfcAdapter#ACTION_NDEF_DISCOVERED} for more detail. If the tag does not contain
 NDEF data, or if no activity is registered
 for {@link android.nfc.NfcAdapter#ACTION_NDEF_DISCOVERED} with a matching data URI or MIME type then dispatch
 moves to stage 3.
 &lt;h4&gt;3. Tag Technology dispatch&lt;/h4&gt;
 {@link Context#startActivity} is called with {@link android.nfc.NfcAdapter#ACTION_TECH_DISCOVERED} to
 dispatch the tag to an activity that can handle the technologies present on the tag.
 Technologies are defined as sub-classes of {@link android.nfc.TagTechnology}, see the package
 {@link android.nfc.tech}. The Android OS looks for an activity that can handle one or
 more technologies in the tag. See {@link android.nfc.NfcAdapter#ACTION_TECH_DISCOVERED} for more detail.
 &lt;h4&gt;4. Fall-back dispatch&lt;/h4&gt;
 If no activity has been matched then {@link Context#startActivity} is called with
 {@link android.nfc.NfcAdapter#ACTION_TAG_DISCOVERED}. This is intended as a fall-back mechanism.
 See {@link android.nfc.NfcAdapter#ACTION_TAG_DISCOVERED}.

 &lt;h3&gt;NFC Tag Background&lt;/h3&gt;
 An NFC tag is a passive NFC device, powered by the NFC field of this Android device while
 it is in range. Tag's can come in many forms, such as stickers, cards, key fobs, or
 even embedded in a more sophisticated device.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Tags can have a wide range of capabilities. Simple tags just offer read/write semantics,
 and contain some one time
 programmable areas to make read-only. More complex tags offer math operations
 and per-sector access control and authentication. The most sophisticated tags
 contain operating environments allowing complex interactions with the
 code executing on the tag. Use {@link android.nfc.TagTechnology} classes to access a broad
 range of capabilities available in NFC tags.
