 A &lt;code&gt;TransitionPropagation&lt;/code&gt; that propagates based on the distance to the side
 and, orthogonally, the distance to epicenter. If the transitioning View is visible in
 the start of the transition, then it will transition sooner when closer to the side and
 later when farther. If the view is not visible in the start of the transition, then
 it will transition later when closer to the side and sooner when farther from the edge.
 This is the default TransitionPropagation used with {@link android.transition.Slide}.

 closer to the side and later when farther. If the view is not visible in the start of
 the transition, then it will transition later when closer to the side and sooner when

@param {Number} side The side that is used to calculate the transition propagation. Must be one of

 set in {@link #setSide}(int) and View centered at the opposite edge will have a difference
 in start delay of approximately the duration of the Transition. A speed of 2 means the
 start delay difference will be approximately half of the duration of the transition. A
 value of 0 is illegal, but negative values will invert the propagation.
@param {Number} propagationSpeed The speed at which propagation occurs, relative to the duration
                         of the transition. A speed of 4 means it works 4 times as fast
                         as the duration of the transition. May not be 0.
