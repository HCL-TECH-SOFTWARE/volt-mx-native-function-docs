</span>@extends android.inputmethodservice.AbstractInputMethodService

 InputMethodService provides a standard implementation of an InputMethod,
 which final implementations can derive from and customize.  See the
 base class {@link android.inputmethodservice.AbstractInputMethodService} and the {@link InputMethod}
 interface for more information on the basics of writing input methods.
 
 &lt;p&gt;In addition to the normal Service lifecycle methods, this class
 introduces some new specific callbacks that most subclasses will want
 to make use of:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #onInitializeInterface}() for user-interface initialization,
 in particular to deal with configuration changes while the service is
 running.
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #onBindInput} to find out about switching to a new client.
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #onStartInput} to deal with an input session starting with
 the client.
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #onCreateInputView}(), {@link #onCreateCandidatesView}(),
 and {@link #onCreateExtractTextView}() for non-demand generation of the UI.
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #onStartInputView(EditorInfo, boolean)} to deal with input
 starting within the input area of the IME.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 
 &lt;p&gt;An input method has significant discretion in how it goes about its
 work: the {@link android.inputmethodservice.InputMethodService} provides
 a basic framework for standard UI elements (input view, candidates view,
 and running in fullscreen mode), but it is up to a particular implementor
 to decide how to use them.  For example, one input method could implement
 an input area with a keyboard, another could allow the user to draw text,
 while a third could have no input area (and thus not be visible to the
 user) but instead listen to audio and perform text to speech conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
 
 &lt;p&gt;In the implementation provided here, all of these elements are placed
 together in a single window managed by the InputMethodService.  It will
 execute callbacks as it needs information about them, and provides APIs for
 programmatic control over them.  They layout of these elements is explicitly
 defined:&lt;/p&gt;
 
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The soft input view, if available, is placed at the bottom of the
 screen.
 &lt;li&gt;The candidates view, if currently shown, is placed above the soft
 input view.
 &lt;li&gt;If not running fullscreen, the application is moved or resized to be
 above these views; if running fullscreen, the window will completely cover
 the application and its top part will contain the extract text of what is
 currently being edited by the application.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 
 
 &lt;a name=&quot;SoftInputView&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Soft Input View&lt;/h3&gt;
 
 &lt;p&gt;Central to most input methods is the soft input view.  This is where most
 user interaction occurs: pressing on soft keys, drawing characters, or
 however else your input method wants to generate text.  Most implementations
 will simply have their own view doing all of this work, and return a new
 instance of it when {@link #onCreateInputView}() is called.  At that point,
 as long as the input view is visible, you will see user interaction in
 that view and can call back on the InputMethodService to interact with the
 application as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
 
 &lt;p&gt;There are some situations where you want to decide whether or not your
 soft input view should be shown to the user.  This is done by implementing
 the {@link #onEvaluateInputViewShown}() to return true or false based on
 whether it should be shown in the current environment.  If any of your
 state has changed that may impact this, call
 {@link #updateInputViewShown}() to have it re-evaluated.  The default
 implementation always shows the input view unless there is a hard
 keyboard available, which is the appropriate behavior for most input
 methods.&lt;/p&gt;
 
 
 &lt;a name=&quot;CandidatesView&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Candidates View&lt;/h3&gt;
 
 &lt;p&gt;Often while the user is generating raw text, an input method wants to
 provide them with a list of possible interpretations of that text that can
 be selected for use.  This is accomplished with the candidates view, and
 like the soft input view you implement {@link #onCreateCandidatesView}()
 to instantiate your own view implementing your candidates UI.&lt;/p&gt;
 
 &lt;p&gt;Management of the candidates view is a little different than the input
 view, because the candidates view tends to be more transient, being shown
 only when there are possible candidates for the current text being entered
 by the user.  To control whether the candidates view is shown, you use
 {@link #setCandidatesViewShown}(boolean).  Note that because the candidate
 view tends to be shown and hidden a lot, it does not impact the application
 UI in the same way as the soft input view: it will never cause application
 windows to resize, only cause them to be panned if needed for the user to
 see the current focus.&lt;/p&gt;
 
 
 &lt;a name=&quot;FullscreenMode&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Fullscreen Mode&lt;/h3&gt;
 
 &lt;p&gt;Sometimes your input method UI is too large to integrate with the
 application UI, so you just want to take over the screen.  This is
 accomplished by switching to full-screen mode, causing the input method
 window to fill the entire screen and add its own &quot;extracted text&quot; editor
 showing the user the text that is being typed.  Unlike the other UI elements,
 there is a standard implementation for the extract editor that you should
 not need to change.  The editor is placed at the top of the IME, above the
 input and candidates views.&lt;/p&gt;
 
 &lt;p&gt;Similar to the input view, you control whether the IME is running in
 fullscreen mode by implementing {@link #onEvaluateFullscreenMode}()
 to return true or false based on
 whether it should be fullscreen in the current environment.  If any of your
 state has changed that may impact this, call
 {@link #updateFullscreenMode}() to have it re-evaluated.  The default
 implementation selects fullscreen mode when the screen is in a landscape
 orientation, which is appropriate behavior for most input methods that have
 a significant input area.&lt;/p&gt;
 
 &lt;p&gt;When in fullscreen mode, you have some special requirements because the
 user can not see the application UI.  In particular, you should implement
 {@link #onDisplayCompletions(CompletionInfo[])} to show completions
 generated by your application, typically in your candidates view like you
 would normally show candidates.
 
 
 &lt;a name=&quot;GeneratingText&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Generating Text&lt;/h3&gt;
 
 &lt;p&gt;The key part of an IME is of course generating text for the application.
 This is done through calls to the
 {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputConnection} interface to the
 application, which can be retrieved from {@link #getCurrentInputConnection}().
 This interface allows you to generate raw key events or, if the target
 supports it, directly edit in strings of candidates and committed text.&lt;/p&gt;
 
 &lt;p&gt;Information about what the target is expected and supports can be found
 through the {@link android.view.inputmethod.EditorInfo} class, which is
 retrieved with {@link #getCurrentInputEditorInfo}() method.  The most
 important part of this is {@link android.view.inputmethod.EditorInfo#inputType
 EditorInfo.inputType}; in particular, if this is
 {@link android.view.inputmethod.EditorInfo#TYPE_NULL EditorInfo.TYPE_NULL},
 then the target does not support complex edits and you need to only deliver
 raw key events to it.  An input method will also want to look at other
 values here, to for example detect password mode, auto complete text views,
 phone number entry, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
 
 &lt;p&gt;When the user switches between input targets, you will receive calls to
 {@link #onFinishInput}() and {@link #onStartInput(EditorInfo, boolean)}.
 You can use these to reset and initialize your input state for the current
 target.  For example, you will often want to clear any input state, and
 update a soft keyboard to be appropriate for the new inputType.&lt;/p&gt;
