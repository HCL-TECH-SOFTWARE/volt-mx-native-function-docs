<span id='com-android-bitmap-drawable-ExtendedBitmapDrawable-ExtendedOptions-property-FEATURE_ORDERED_DISPLAY'>/** Summary:
</span> This feature enables you to draw decoded bitmap in order on the screen, to give the
 visual effect of a single decode thread.

 &lt;p/&gt;
 Explanation:
 Since DecodeTasks are asynchronous, multiple tasks may finish decoding at different
 times. To have a smooth user experience, provide a shared {@link DecodeAggregator} to all
 the ExtendedBitmapDrawables, and the decode aggregator will hold finished decodes so they
 come back in order.

 &lt;p/&gt;
 Pros:
 Visual consistency. Images are not popping up randomly all over the place.

 &lt;p/&gt;
 Cons:
 Artificial delay. Images are not drawn as soon as they are decoded. They must wait
 for their turn.

 &lt;p/&gt;
 Requirements:
 Set {@link #decodeAggregator} to a shared {@link DecodeAggregator}.

<span id='com-android-bitmap-drawable-ExtendedBitmapDrawable-ExtendedOptions-property-FEATURE_PARALLAX'>/** Summary:
</span> This feature enables the image to move in parallax as the user scrolls, to give visual
 flair to your images.

 &lt;p/&gt;
 Explanation:
 When the user scrolls D pixels in the vertical direction, this ExtendedBitmapDrawable
 shifts its Bitmap f(D) pixels in the vertical direction before drawing to the screen.
 Depending on the function f, the parallax effect can give varying interesting results.

 &lt;p/&gt;
 Pros:
 Visual pop and playfulness. Feeling of movement. Pleasantly surprise your users.

 &lt;p/&gt;
 Cons:
 Some users report motion sickness with certain speed multiplier values. Decode height
 must be greater than visual bounds to account for the parallax. This uses more memory and
 decoding time.

 &lt;p/&gt;
 Requirements:
 Set {@link #parallaxSpeedMultiplier} to the ratio between the decoded height and the
 visual bound height. Call {@link com.android.bitmap.drawable.ExtendedBitmapDrawable#setDecodeDimensions(int, int)}
 with the height multiplied by {@link #parallaxSpeedMultiplier}.
 Call {@link com.android.bitmap.drawable.ExtendedBitmapDrawable#setParallaxFraction(float)} when the user scrolls.

<span id='com-android-bitmap-drawable-ExtendedBitmapDrawable-ExtendedOptions-property-FEATURE_STATE_CHANGES'>/** Summary:
</span> This feature enables fading in between multiple decode states, to give smooth transitions
 to and from the placeholder, progress bars, and decoded image.

 &lt;p/&gt;
 Explanation:
 The states are: {@link com.android.bitmap.drawable.ExtendedBitmapDrawable#LOAD_STATE_UNINITIALIZED},
 {@link com.android.bitmap.drawable.ExtendedBitmapDrawable#LOAD_STATE_NOT_YET_LOADED},
 {@link com.android.bitmap.drawable.ExtendedBitmapDrawable#LOAD_STATE_LOADING},
 {@link com.android.bitmap.drawable.ExtendedBitmapDrawable#LOAD_STATE_LOADED}, and
 {@link com.android.bitmap.drawable.ExtendedBitmapDrawable#LOAD_STATE_FAILED}. These states affect whether the
 placeholder and/or the progress bar is showing and animating. We first show the
 pulsating placeholder when an image begins decoding. After 2 seconds, we fade in a
 spinning progress bar. When the decode completes, we fade in the image.

 &lt;p/&gt;
 Pros:
 Smooth, beautiful transitions avoid perceived jank. Progress indicator informs users that
 work is being done and the app is not stalled.

 &lt;p/&gt;
 Cons:
 Very fast decodes' short decode time would be eclipsed by the animation duration. Static
 placeholder could be accomplished by {@link com.android.bitmap.drawable.BasicBitmapDrawable} without the added
 complexity of states.

 &lt;p/&gt;
 Requirements:
 Set {@link #backgroundColor} to the color used for the background of the placeholder and
 progress bar. Use the alternative constructor to populate {@link #placeholder} and
 {@link #progressBar}. Optionally set {@link #placeholderAnimationDuration}.

 A value of 1.5f gives a subtle parallax, and is a good value to
