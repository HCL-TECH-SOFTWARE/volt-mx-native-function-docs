 Used to record various statistics about the result of a sync operation. The SyncManager

 disposition of the sync. See {@link android.content.SyncResult} for further dicussion on how the
 SyncManager uses these values.

 increment this value although it may still do so in order to record that it had to
 perform some cleanup. E.g., if the SyncAdapter received a bad entry from the server
 when processing a feed of entries, it may choose to drop the entry and thus make
 progress and still increment this value just so the SyncAdapter can record that an
 error occurred. This is considered a hard error.
