</span> implements android.view.WindowManagerPolicyConstants

 This interface supplies all UI-specific behavior of the window manager.  An
 instance of it is created by the window manager when it starts up, and allows
 customization of window layering, special window types, key dispatching, and
 layout.

 &lt;p&gt;Because this provides deep interaction with the system window manager,
 specific methods on this interface can be called from a variety of contexts
 with various restrictions on what they can do.  These are encoded through
 a suffixes at the end of a method encoding the thread the method is called
 from and any locks that are held when it is being called; if no suffix
 is attached to a method, then it is not called with any locks and may be
 called from the main window manager thread or another thread calling into
 the window manager.

 &lt;p&gt;The current suffixes are:

 &lt;dl&gt;
 &lt;dt&gt; Ti &lt;dd&gt; Called from the input thread.  This is the thread that
 collects pending input events and dispatches them to the appropriate window.
 It may block waiting for events to be processed, so that the input stream is
 properly serialized.
 &lt;dt&gt; Tq &lt;dd&gt; Called from the low-level input queue thread.  This is the
 thread that reads events out of the raw input devices and places them
 into the global input queue that is read by the &lt;var&gt;Ti&lt;/var&gt; thread.
 This thread should not block for a long period of time on anything but the
 key driver.
 &lt;dt&gt; Lw &lt;dd&gt; Called with the main window manager lock held.  Because the
 window manager is a very low-level system service, there are few other
 system services you can call with this lock held.  It is explicitly okay to
 make calls into the package manager and power manager; it is explicitly not
 okay to make calls into the activity manager or most other services.  Note that
 {@link android.content.Context#checkPermission(String, int, int)} and
 variations require calling into the activity manager.
 &lt;dt&gt; Li &lt;dd&gt; Called with the input thread lock held.  This lock can be
 acquired by the window manager while it holds the window lock, so this is
 even more restrictive than &lt;var&gt;Lw&lt;/var&gt;.
 &lt;/dl&gt;
