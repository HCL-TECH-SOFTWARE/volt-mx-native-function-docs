</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 A simple in-process event bus.  It is simple because we can make assumptions about the state of
 SystemUI and Recent's lifecycle.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Currently, there is a single EventBus that handles {@link com.android.systemui.recents.events.EventBus.EventBus.com.android.systemui.recents.events.EventBus.Event}s for each subscriber
 on the main application thread.  Publishers can send() events to synchronously call subscribers
 of that event, or post() events to be processed in the next run of the {@link Looper}.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Subscribers must be registered with a particular EventBus before they will receive events, and
 handler methods must match a specific signature.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Event method signature:&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Methods must be public final
 &lt;li&gt;Methods must return void
 &lt;li&gt;Methods must be called &quot;onBusEvent&quot;
 &lt;li&gt;Methods must take one parameter, of class type deriving from {@link com.android.systemui.recents.events.EventBus.EventBus.com.android.systemui.recents.events.EventBus.Event}
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
 Each subscriber can be registered with a given priority (default 1), and events will be dispatch
 in decreasing order of priority.  For subscribers with the same priority, events will be
 dispatched by latest registration time to earliest.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Caveats:&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The EventBus keeps a {@link WeakReference} to the publisher to prevent memory leaks, so
 there must be another strong reference to the publisher for it to not get garbage-collected and
 continue receiving events.
 &lt;li&gt;Because the event handlers are called back using reflection, the EventBus is not intended
 for use in tight, performance criticial loops.  For most user input/system callback events, this
 is generally of low enough frequency to use the EventBus.
 &lt;li&gt;Because the event handlers are called back using reflection, there will often be no
 references to them from actual code.  The proguard configuration will be need to be updated to
 keep these extra methods:

 -keepclassmembers class ** {
 public void onBusEvent(**);
 public void onInterprocessBusEvent(**);
 }
 -keepclassmembers class ** extends **.EventBus$InterprocessEvent {
 public &lt;init&gt;(android.os.Bundle);
 }

 &lt;li&gt;Subscriber registration can be expensive depending on the subscriber's {@link Class}.  This
 is only done once per class type, but if possible, it is best to pre-register an instance of
 that class beforehand or when idle.
 &lt;li&gt;Each event should be sent once.  Events may hold internal information about the current
 dispatch, or may be queued to be dispatched on another thread (if posted from a non-main thread),
 so it may be unsafe to edit, change, or re-send the event again.
 &lt;li&gt;Events should follow a pattern of public-final POD (plain old data) objects, where they are
 initialized by the constructor and read by each subscriber of that event.  Subscribers should
 never alter events as they are processed, and this enforces that pattern.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 Future optimizations:
 &lt;li&gt;throw exception/log when a subscriber loses the reference
 &lt;li&gt;trace cost per registration &amp; invocation
 &lt;li&gt;trace cross-process invocation
 &lt;li&gt;register(subscriber, Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;...) -- pass in exact class types you want registered
 &lt;li&gt;setSubscriberEventHandlerPriority(subscriber, Class&lt;Event&gt;, priority)
 &lt;li&gt;allow subscribers to implement interface, ie. EventBus.Subscriber, which lets then test a
 message before invocation (ie. check if task id == this task id)
 &lt;li&gt;add postOnce() which automatically debounces
 &lt;li&gt;add postDelayed() which delays / postDelayedOnce() which delays and bounces
 &lt;li&gt;consolidate register() and registerInterprocess()
 &lt;li&gt;sendForResult&amp;lt;ReturnType&amp;gt;(Event) to send and get a result, but who will send the
 result?
 &lt;/p&gt;
