</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Allows an application to keep the Wi-Fi radio awake.
 Normally the Wi-Fi radio may turn off when the user has not used the device in a while.
 Acquiring a WifiLock will keep the radio on until the lock is released.  Multiple
 applications may hold WifiLocks, and the radio will only be allowed to turn off when no
 WifiLocks are held in any application.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Before using a WifiLock, consider carefully if your application requires Wi-Fi access, or
 could function over a mobile network, if available.  A program that needs to download large
 files should hold a WifiLock to ensure that the download will complete, but a program whose
 network usage is occasional or low-bandwidth should not hold a WifiLock to avoid adversely
 affecting battery life.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Note that WifiLocks cannot override the user-level &quot;Wi-Fi Enabled&quot; setting, nor Airplane
 Mode.  They simply keep the radio from turning off when Wi-Fi is already on but the device
 is idle.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Any application using a WifiLock must request the {@code android.permission.WAKE_LOCK}
 permission in an {@code &lt;uses-permission&gt;} element of the application's manifest.

 If this WifiLock is not reference-counted, the first call to {@code acquire} will lock
 the radio, but subsequent calls will be ignored.  Only one call to {@link #release}
