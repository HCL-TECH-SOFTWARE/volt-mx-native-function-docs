 Group Key Handshake; with IEEE 802.1X (non-WPA) connection is
 completed after dynamic keys are received (or if not used, after
 the EAP authentication has been completed). With static WEP keys and
 plaintext connections, this state is entered when an association

 This state indicates that the supplicant has completed its
 processing for the association phase and that data connection is
 fully configured. Note, however, that there may not be any IP
