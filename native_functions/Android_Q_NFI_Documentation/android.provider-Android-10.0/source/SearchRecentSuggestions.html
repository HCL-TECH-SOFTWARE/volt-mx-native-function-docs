 This is a utility class providing access to
 {@link android.content.SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider}.

 &lt;p&gt;Unlike some utility classes, this one must be instantiated and properly initialized, so that
 it can be configured to operate with the search suggestions provider that you have created.

 &lt;p&gt;Typically, you will do this in your searchable activity, each time you receive an incoming
 {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_SEARCH ACTION_SEARCH} Intent.  The code to record each
 incoming query is as follows:
 &lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
      SearchSuggestions suggestions = new SearchSuggestions(this,
              MySuggestionsProvider.AUTHORITY, MySuggestionsProvider.MODE);
      suggestions.saveRecentQuery(queryString, null);
 &lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For a working example, see SearchSuggestionSampleProvider and SearchQueryResults in
 samples/ApiDemos/app.

 &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}guide/topics/search/adding-recent-query-suggestions.html&quot;&gt;Adding Recent Query
