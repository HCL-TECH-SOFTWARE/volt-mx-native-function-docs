</span> implements android.media.AudioRouting

 implements android.media.VolumeAutomation

@extends android.media.PlayerBase

 The AudioTrack class manages and plays a single audio resource for Java applications.
 It allows streaming of PCM audio buffers to the audio sink for playback. This is
 achieved by &quot;pushing&quot; the data to the AudioTrack object using one of the
  {@link #write(byte[], int, int)}, {@link #write(short[], int, int)},
  and {@link #write(float[], int, int, int)} methods.

 &lt;p&gt;An AudioTrack instance can operate under two modes: static or streaming.&lt;br&gt;
 In Streaming mode, the application writes a continuous stream of data to the AudioTrack, using
 one of the {@code write()} methods. These are blocking and return when the data has been
 transferred from the Java layer to the native layer and queued for playback. The streaming
 mode is most useful when playing blocks of audio data that for instance are:

 &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;too big to fit in memory because of the duration of the sound to play,&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;too big to fit in memory because of the characteristics of the audio data
         (high sampling rate, bits per sample ...)&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;received or generated while previously queued audio is playing.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 The static mode should be chosen when dealing with short sounds that fit in memory and
 that need to be played with the smallest latency possible. The static mode will
 therefore be preferred for UI and game sounds that are played often, and with the
 smallest overhead possible.

 &lt;p&gt;Upon creation, an AudioTrack object initializes its associated audio buffer.
 The size of this buffer, specified during the construction, determines how long an AudioTrack
 can play before running out of data.&lt;br&gt;
 For an AudioTrack using the static mode, this size is the maximum size of the sound that can
 be played from it.&lt;br&gt;
 For the streaming mode, data will be written to the audio sink in chunks of
 sizes less than or equal to the total buffer size.

 AudioTrack is not final and thus permits subclasses, but such use is not recommended.
