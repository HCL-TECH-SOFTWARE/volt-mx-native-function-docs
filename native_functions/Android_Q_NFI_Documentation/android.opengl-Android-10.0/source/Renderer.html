</span> A generic renderer interface.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The renderer is responsible for making OpenGL calls to render a frame.
 &lt;p&gt;
 GLSurfaceView clients typically create their own classes that implement
 this interface, and then call {@link android.opengl.GLSurfaceView#setRenderer} to
 register the renderer with the GLSurfaceView.
 &lt;p&gt;

 &lt;div class=&quot;special reference&quot;&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Developer Guides&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;For more information about how to use OpenGL, read the
 &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}guide/topics/graphics/opengl.html&quot;&gt;OpenGL&lt;/a&gt; developer guide.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;h3&gt;Threading&lt;/h3&gt;
 The renderer will be called on a separate thread, so that rendering
 performance is decoupled from the UI thread. Clients typically need to
 communicate with the renderer from the UI thread, because that's where
 input events are received. Clients can communicate using any of the
 standard Java techniques for cross-thread communication, or they can
 use the {@link android.opengl.GLSurfaceView#queueEvent(Runnable)} convenience method.
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;EGL Context Lost&lt;/h3&gt;
 There are situations where the EGL rendering context will be lost. This
 typically happens when device wakes up after going to sleep. When
 the EGL context is lost, all OpenGL resources (such as textures) that are
 associated with that context will be automatically deleted. In order to
 keep rendering correctly, a renderer must recreate any lost resources
 that it still needs. The {@link #onSurfaceCreated(GL10, android.opengl.EGLConfig)} method
 is a convenient place to do this.


 @see #setRenderer(Renderer)

var Renderer = {

<span id='android-opengl-GLSurfaceView-Renderer-method-onSurfaceCreated'>/**Called when the surface is created or recreated.
</span> &lt;p&gt;
 Called when the rendering thread
 starts and whenever the EGL context is lost. The EGL context will typically
 be lost when the Android device awakes after going to sleep.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Since this method is called at the beginning of rendering, as well as
 every time the EGL context is lost, this method is a convenient place to put
 code to create resources that need to be created when the rendering
 starts, and that need to be recreated when the EGL context is lost.
 Textures are an example of a resource that you might want to create
 here.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Note that when the EGL context is lost, all OpenGL resources associated
 with that context will be automatically deleted. You do not need to call
 the corresponding &quot;glDelete&quot; methods such as glDeleteTextures to
 manually delete these lost resources.
 &lt;p&gt;
@param {Object {GL10}} gl the GL interface. Use &lt;code&gt;instanceof&lt;/code&gt; to
 test if the interface supports GL11 or higher interfaces.
@param {Object {EGLConfig}} config the EGLConfig of the created surface. Can be used
 to create matching pbuffers.

onSurfaceCreated : function(  ) {},

<span id='android-opengl-GLSurfaceView-Renderer-method-onSurfaceChanged'>/**Called when the surface changed size.
</span> &lt;p&gt;
 Called after the surface is created and whenever
 the OpenGL ES surface size changes.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Typically you will set your viewport here. If your camera
 is fixed then you could also set your projection matrix here:
 &lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
 void onSurfaceChanged(GL10 gl, int width, int height) {
     gl.glViewport(0, 0, width, height);
     // for a fixed camera, set the projection too
     float ratio = (float) width / height;
     gl.glMatrixMode(GL10.GL_PROJECTION);
     gl.glLoadIdentity();
     gl.glFrustumf(-ratio, ratio, -1, 1, 1, 10);
 }
 &lt;/pre&gt;
@param {Object {GL10}} gl the GL interface. Use &lt;code&gt;instanceof&lt;/code&gt; to
 test if the interface supports GL11 or higher interfaces.
@param {Number} width
@param {Number} height

<span id='android-opengl-GLSurfaceView-Renderer-method-onDrawFrame'>/**Called to draw the current frame.
</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This method is responsible for drawing the current frame.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The implementation of this method typically looks like this:
 &lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
 void onDrawFrame(GL10 gl) {
     gl.glClear(GL10.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL10.GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
     //... other gl calls to render the scene ...
 }
 &lt;/pre&gt;
@param {Object {GL10}} gl the GL interface. Use &lt;code&gt;instanceof&lt;/code&gt; to
 test if the interface supports GL11 or higher interfaces.
