 Monitors the installed applications associated with time zone updates. If the app packages are
 updated it indicates there &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be a time zone rules update to apply so a targeted
 broadcast intent is used to trigger the time zone updater app.

 &lt;p&gt;The &quot;update triggering&quot; behavior of this component can be disabled via device configuration.

 &lt;p&gt;The package tracker listens for package updates of the time zone &quot;updater app&quot; and &quot;data app&quot;.
 It also listens for &quot;reliability&quot; triggers. Reliability triggers are there to ensure that the
 package tracker handles failures reliably and are &quot;idle maintenance&quot; events or something similar.
 Reliability triggers can cause a time zone update check to take place if the current state is
 unclear. For example, it can be unclear after boot or after a failure. If there are repeated
 failures reliability updates are halted until the next boot.

 &lt;p&gt;This component keeps persistent track of the most recent app packages checked to avoid
 unnecessary expense from broadcasting intents (which will cause other app processes to spawn).
 The current status is also stored to detect whether the most recently-generated check is
 complete successfully. For example, if the device was interrupted while doing a check and never
 acknowledged a check then a check will be retried the next time a &quot;reliability trigger&quot; event
 happens.
