</span>@extends android.content.BroadcastReceiver

 A convenience class to aid in implementing an AppWidget provider.
 Everything you can do with AppWidgetProvider, you can do with a regular {@link BroadcastReceiver}.
 AppWidgetProvider merely parses the relevant fields out of the Intent that is received in
 {@link #onReceive(Context,Intent) onReceive(Context,Intent)}, and calls hook methods
 with the received extras.

 &lt;p&gt;Extend this class and override one or more of the {@link #onUpdate}, {@link #onDeleted},
 {@link #onEnabled} or {@link #onDisabled} methods to implement your own AppWidget functionality.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;div class=&quot;special reference&quot;&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Developer Guides&lt;/h3&gt;
