 Note that this will &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; inform the view system of a full inset change via

 animation. If you'd like to animate views during a window inset animation, register a
 {@link android.view.WindowInsetsAnimationListener} by calling
 {@link android.view.View#setWindowInsetsAnimationListener(WindowInsetsAnimationListener)} that will be
 notified about any insets change via {@link android.view.WindowInsetsAnimationListener#onProgress} during
 the animation.

 {@link android.view.View#dispatchApplyWindowInsets} will instead be called once the animation has
 finished, i.e. once {@link #finish} has been called.
@param {Object {Insets}} insets The new insets to apply. Based on the requested insets, the system will
               calculate the positions of the windows in the system causing insets such that
               the resulting insets of that configuration will match the passed in parameter.
               Note that these insets are being clamped to the range from
               {@link #getHiddenStateInsets} to {@link #getShownStateInsets}
