</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Describes a set of insets for window content.

 &lt;p&gt;WindowInsets are immutable and may be expanded to include more inset types in the future.
 To adjust insets, use one of the supplied clone methods to obtain a new WindowInsets instance
 with the adjusted properties.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Note: Before {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#P P}, WindowInsets instances were only
 immutable during a single layout pass (i.e. would return the same values between
 {@link android.view.View#onApplyWindowInsets} and {@link android.view.View#onLayout}, but could return other values
 otherwise). Starting with {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#P P}, WindowInsets are
 always immutable and implement equality.
