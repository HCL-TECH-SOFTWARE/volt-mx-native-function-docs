 is the same as {@link android.view.WindowInsetsAnimationController#getHiddenStateInsets} and
 {@link android.view.WindowInsetsAnimationController#getShownStateInsets} in case the listener gets
 invoked because of an animation that originates from
 {@link android.view.WindowInsetsAnimationController}.

 However, if the size of a window that causes insets is changing, these are the
 lower/upper bounds of that size animation.
 &lt;p&gt;
 There are no overlapping animations for a specific type, but there may be two animations
 running at the same time for different inset types.
@see #getUpperBound()
@see WindowInsetsAnimationController#getHiddenStateInsets
 TODO: It's a bit weird that these are global per window but onProgress is hierarchical.
 TODO: If multiple types are animating, querying the bound per type isn't possible. Should
 we:
 1. Offer bounds by type here?
 2. Restrict one animation to one single type only?
 Returning WindowInsets here isn't feasible in case of overlapping animations: We can't
 fill in the insets for the types from the other animation into the WindowInsets object
 as it's changing as well.
