</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 This class encapsulates the interaction between a print service and the
 system during printer discovery. During printer discovery you are responsible
 for adding discovered printers, removing previously added printers that
 disappeared, and updating already added printers.
 &lt;p&gt;
 During the lifetime of this session you may be asked to start and stop
 performing printer discovery multiple times. You will receive a call to {@link android.printservice.PrinterDiscoverySession#onStartPrinterDiscovery(List)} to start printer
 discovery and a call to {@link android.printservice.PrinterDiscoverySession#onStopPrinterDiscovery()}
 to stop printer discovery. When the system is no longer interested in printers
 discovered by this session you will receive a call to {@link #onDestroy}() at
 which point the system will no longer call into the session and all the session
 methods will do nothing.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 Discovered printers are added by invoking {@link android.printservice.PrinterDiscoverySession#addPrinters(List)}. Added printers that disappeared are
 removed by invoking {@link android.printservice.PrinterDiscoverySession#removePrinters(List)}. Added
 printers whose properties or capabilities changed are updated through a call to
 {@link android.printservice.PrinterDiscoverySession#addPrinters(List)}. The printers added in this
 session can be acquired via {@link #getPrinters}() where the returned printers
 will be an up-to-date snapshot of the printers that you reported during the
 session. Printers are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; persisted across sessions.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 The system will make a call to {@link #onValidatePrinters}(List) if you
 need to update some printers. It is possible that you add a printer without
 specifying its capabilities. This enables you to avoid querying all discovered
 printers for their capabilities, rather querying the capabilities of a printer
 only if necessary. For example, the system will request that you update a printer
 if it gets selected by the user. When validating printers you do not need to
 provide the printers' capabilities but may do so.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 If the system is interested in being constantly updated for the state of a
 printer you will receive a call to {@link #onStartPrinterStateTracking}(PrinterId)
 after which you will have to do a best effort to keep the system updated for
 changes in the printer state and capabilities. You also &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt;
 update the printer capabilities if you did not provide them when adding it, or
 the printer will be ignored. When the system is no longer interested in getting
 updates for a printer you will receive a call to {@link #onStopPrinterStateTracking}(
 PrinterId).
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;Note: &lt;/strong&gt; All callbacks in this class are executed on the main
 application thread. You also have to invoke any method of this class on the main
 application thread.
