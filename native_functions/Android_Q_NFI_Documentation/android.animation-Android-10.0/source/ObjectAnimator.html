</span>@extends android.animation.ValueAnimator

 This subclass of {@link android.animation.ValueAnimator} provides support for animating properties on target objects.
 The constructors of this class take parameters to define the target object that will be animated
 as well as the name of the property that will be animated. Appropriate set/get functions
 are then determined internally and the animation will call these functions as necessary to
 animate the property.

 &lt;p&gt;Animators can be created from either code or resource files, as shown here:&lt;/p&gt;

 {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/res/anim/object_animator.xml ObjectAnimatorResources}

 &lt;p&gt;Starting from API 23, it is possible to use {@link android.animation.PropertyValuesHolder.PropertyValuesHolder} and
 {@link android.animation.Keyframe} in resource files to create more complex animations. Using PropertyValuesHolders
 allows animators to animate several properties in parallel, as shown in this sample:&lt;/p&gt;

 {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/res/anim/object_animator_pvh.xml
 PropertyValuesHolderResources}

 &lt;p&gt;Using Keyframes allows animations to follow more complex paths from the start
 to the end values. Note that you can specify explicit fractional values (from 0 to 1) for
 each keyframe to determine when, in the overall duration, the animation should arrive at that
 value. Alternatively, you can leave the fractions off and the keyframes will be equally
 distributed within the total duration. Also, a keyframe with no value will derive its value
 from the target object when the animator starts, just like animators with only one
 value specified. In addition, an optional interpolator can be specified. The interpolator will
 be applied on the interval between the keyframe that the interpolator is set on and the previous
 keyframe. When no interpolator is supplied, the default {@link AccelerateDecelerateInterpolator}
 will be used. &lt;/p&gt;

 {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/res/anim/object_animator_pvh_kf_interpolated.xml KeyframeResources}

 &lt;h3&gt;Developer Guides&lt;/h3&gt;

 &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}guide/topics/graphics/prop-animation.html#object-animator&quot;&gt;Property
 Animation&lt;/a&gt; developer guide.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

var ObjectAnimator = {

<span id='android-animation-ObjectAnimator-method-setPropertyName'>/**Sets the name of the property that will be animated. This name is used to derive
</span> a setter function that will be called to set animated values.
 For example, a property name of &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; will result
 in a call to the function &lt;code&gt;setFoo()&lt;/code&gt; on the target object. If either
 &lt;code&gt;valueFrom&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;valueTo&lt;/code&gt; is null, then a getter function will
 also be derived and called.

 &lt;p&gt;For best performance of the mechanism that calls the setter function determined by the
 name of the property being animated, use &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; typed values,
 and make the setter function for those properties have a &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; return value. This
 will cause the code to take an optimized path for these constrained circumstances. Other
 property types and return types will work, but will have more overhead in processing
 the requests due to normal reflection mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Note that the setter function derived from this property name
 must take the same parameter type as the
 &lt;code&gt;valueFrom&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;valueTo&lt;/code&gt; properties, otherwise the call to
 the setter function will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If this ObjectAnimator has been set up to animate several properties together,
 using more than one PropertyValuesHolder objects, then setting the propertyName simply
 sets the propertyName in the first of those PropertyValuesHolder objects.&lt;/p&gt;
