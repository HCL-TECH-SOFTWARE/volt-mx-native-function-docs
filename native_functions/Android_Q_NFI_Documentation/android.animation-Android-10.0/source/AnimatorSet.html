</span> implements android.animation.AnimationHandler.AnimationFrameCallback

@extends android.animation.Animator

 This class plays a set of {@link android.animation.Animator} objects in the specified order. Animations
 can be set up to play together, in sequence, or after a specified delay.

 &lt;p&gt;There are two different approaches to adding animations to a &lt;code&gt;AnimatorSet&lt;/code&gt;:
 either the {@link android.animation.AnimatorSet#playTogether(Animator[]) playTogether()} or
 {@link android.animation.AnimatorSet#playSequentially(Animator[]) playSequentially()} methods can be called to add
 a set of animations all at once, or the {@link android.animation.AnimatorSet#play(Animator)} can be
 used in conjunction with methods in the {@link AnimatorSet.android.animation.AnimatorSet.Builder android.animation.AnimatorSet.Builder}
 class to add animations
 one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It is possible to set up a &lt;code&gt;AnimatorSet&lt;/code&gt; with circular dependencies between
 its animations. For example, an animation a1 could be set up to start before animation a2, a2
 before a3, and a3 before a1. The results of this configuration are undefined, but will typically
 result in none of the affected animations being played. Because of this (and because
 circular dependencies do not make logical sense anyway), circular dependencies
 should be avoided, and the dependency flow of animations should only be in one direction.

 tells the &lt;code&gt;Builder&lt;/code&gt; the animation that is the dependency for
 the succeeding commands to the &lt;code&gt;Builder&lt;/code&gt;. For example,
 calling &lt;code&gt;play(a1).with(a2)&lt;/code&gt; sets up the AnimatorSet to play
 &lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a2&lt;/code&gt; at the same time,
