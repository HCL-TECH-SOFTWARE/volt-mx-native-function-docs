</span>@extends android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSession

 A constrained high speed capture session for a {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice}, used for capturing high
 speed images from the {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice} for high speed video recording use case.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A CameraHighSpeedCaptureSession is created by providing a set of target output surfaces to
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice#createConstrainedHighSpeedCaptureSession}, Once created, the session is
 active until a new session is created by the camera device, or the camera device is closed.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 An active high speed capture session is a specialized capture session that is only targeted at
 high speed video recording (&gt;=120fps) use case if the camera device supports high speed video
 capability (i.e., {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCharacteristics#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES} contains
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraMetadata#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_CONSTRAINED_HIGH_SPEED_VIDEO}). It only
 accepts request lists created via {@link #createHighSpeedRequestList}, and the request list can
 only be submitted to this session via {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSession#captureBurst captureBurst}, or
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSession#setRepeatingBurst setRepeatingBurst}. See
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice#createConstrainedHighSpeedCaptureSession} for more details of the
 limitations.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 Creating a session is an expensive operation and can take several hundred milliseconds, since it
 requires configuring the camera device's internal pipelines and allocating memory buffers for
 sending images to the desired targets. Therefore the setup is done asynchronously, and
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice#createConstrainedHighSpeedCaptureSession} will send the ready-to-use
 CameraCaptureSession to the provided listener's
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onConfigured} callback. If configuration cannot be
 completed, then the {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onConfigureFailed} is called, and
 the session will not become active.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;!--
 &lt;p&gt;
 Any capture requests (repeating or non-repeating) submitted before the session is ready will be
 queued up and will begin capture once the session becomes ready. In case the session cannot be
 configured and {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onConfigureFailed onConfigureFailed} is
 called, all queued capture requests are discarded.  &lt;/p&gt;
 --&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 If a new session is created by the camera device, then the previous session is closed, and its
 associated {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onClosed onClosed} callback will be
 invoked. All of the session methods will throw an IllegalStateException if called once the
 session is closed.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 A closed session clears any repeating requests (as if {@link #stopRepeating} had been called),
 but will still complete all of its in-progress capture requests as normal, before a newly created
 session takes over and reconfigures the camera device.
 &lt;/p&gt;

<span id='android-hardware-camera2-CameraConstrainedHighSpeedCaptureSession-method-createHighSpeedRequestList'>/**&lt;p&gt;Create a unmodifiable list of requests that is suitable for constrained high speed capture
</span> session streaming.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;High speed video streaming creates significant performance pressure on the camera device,
 so to achieve efficient high speed streaming, the camera device may have to aggregate
 multiple frames together. This means requests must be sent in batched groups, with all
 requests sharing the same settings. This method takes the list of output target
 Surfaces (subject to the output Surface requirements specified by the constrained high speed
 session) and a {@link android.hardware.camera2.CaptureRequest request}, and generates a request list that has the same
 controls for each request. The input {@link android.hardware.camera2.CaptureRequest request} must contain the target
 output Surfaces and target high speed FPS range that is one of the
 {@link StreamConfigurationMap#getHighSpeedVideoFpsRangesFor} for the Surface size.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If both preview and recording Surfaces are specified in the {@code request}, the
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CaptureRequest#CONTROL_AE_TARGET_FPS_RANGE target FPS range} in the input
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CaptureRequest request} must be a fixed frame rate FPS range, where the
 {@link android.util.Range#getLower minimal FPS} ==
 {@link android.util.Range#getUpper() maximum FPS}. The created request list will contain
 a interleaved request pattern such that the preview output FPS is at least 30fps, the
 recording output FPS is {@link android.util.Range#getUpper() maximum FPS} of the requested
 FPS range. The application can submit this request list directly to an active high speed
 capture session to achieve high speed video recording. When only preview or recording
 Surface is specified, this method will return a list of request that have the same controls
 and output targets for all requests.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Submitting a request list created by this method to a normal capture session will result
 in an {@link IllegalArgumentException} if the high speed
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CaptureRequest#CONTROL_AE_TARGET_FPS_RANGE FPS range} is not supported by
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCharacteristics#CONTROL_AE_AVAILABLE_TARGET_FPS_RANGES}.&lt;/p&gt;
@param {Object {CaptureRequest}} request The high speed capture request that will be used to generate the high speed
                request list.
@return {Object {java.util.List}} A unmodifiable CaptureRequest list that is suitable for constrained high speed
         capture.
@throws IllegalArgumentException if the set of output Surfaces in the request do not meet the
                                  high speed video capability requirements, or the camera
                                  device doesn't support high speed video capability, or the
                                  request doesn't meet the high speed video capability
                                  requirements, or the request doesn't contain the required
                                  controls for high speed capture.
@throws CameraAccessException if the camera device is no longer connected or has
                               encountered a fatal error
@throws IllegalStateException if the camera device has been closed
