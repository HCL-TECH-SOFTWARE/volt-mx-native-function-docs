 This service's job is to collect aggregate rendering profile data. It
 does this by allowing rendering processes to request an ashmem buffer
 to place their stats into.

 Buffers are rotated on a daily (in UTC) basis and only the 3 most-recent days
 are kept.

 The primary consumer of this is incident reports and automated metric checking. It is not
 intended for end-developer consumption, for that we have gfxinfo.

 Buffer rotation process:
 1) Alarm fires
 2) onRotateGraphicsStatsBuffer() is sent to all active processes
 3) Upon receiving the callback, the process will stop using the previous ashmem buffer and
    request a new one.
 4) When that request is received we now know that the ashmem region is no longer in use so
    it gets queued up for saving to disk and a new ashmem region is created and returned
    for the process to use.
