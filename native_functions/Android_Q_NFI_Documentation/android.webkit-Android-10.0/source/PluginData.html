 This class encapsulates the content generated by a plugin.  The
 data itself is meant to be loaded into webkit via the
 PluginContentLoader class, which needs to be able to construct an
 HTTP response. For this, it needs a stream with the response body,
 the length of the body, the response headers, and the response
 status code. The PluginData class is the container for all these
 parts.
