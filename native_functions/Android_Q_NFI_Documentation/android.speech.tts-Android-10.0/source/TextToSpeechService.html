 Abstract base class for TTS engine implementations. The following methods
 need to be implemented:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@link #onIsLanguageAvailable}&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@link #onLoadLanguage}&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@link #onGetLanguage}&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@link #onSynthesizeText}&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@link #onStop}&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 The first three deal primarily with language management, and are used to
 query the engine for it's support for a given language and indicate to it
 that requests in a given language are imminent.

 {@link #onSynthesizeText} is central to the engine implementation. The
 implementation should synthesize text as per the request parameters and
 return synthesized data via the supplied callback. This class and its helpers
 will then consume that data, which might mean queuing it for playback or writing
 it to a file or similar. All calls to this method will be on a single thread,
 which will be different from the main thread of the service. Synthesis must be
 synchronous which means the engine must NOT hold on to the callback or call any
 methods on it after the method returns.

 {@link #onStop} tells the engine that it should stop
 all ongoing synthesis, if any. Any pending data from the current synthesis
 will be discarded.

 {@link #onGetLanguage} is not required as of JELLYBEAN_MR2 (API 18) and later, it is only
 called on earlier versions of Android.

 API Level 20 adds support for Voice objects. Voices are an abstraction that allow the TTS
 service to expose multiple backends for a single locale. Each one of them can have a different
 features set. In order to fully take advantage of voices, an engine should implement
 the following methods:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@link #onGetVoices}()&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@link #onIsValidVoiceName}(String)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@link #onLoadVoice}(String)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@link #onGetDefaultVoiceNameFor(String, String, String)}&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 The first three methods are siblings of the {@link #onGetLanguage},
 {@link #onIsLanguageAvailable} and {@link #onLoadLanguage} methods. The last one,
 {@link #onGetDefaultVoiceNameFor(String, String, String)} is a link between locale and voice
 based methods. Since API level 21 {@link android.speech.tts.TextToSpeech#setLanguage} is implemented by
 calling {@link android.speech.tts.TextToSpeech#setVoice} with the voice returned by
 {@link #onGetDefaultVoiceNameFor(String, String, String)}.

 If the client uses a voice instead of a locale, {@link android.speech.tts.SynthesisRequest} will contain the
 requested voice name.

 The default implementations of Voice-related methods implement them using the
 pre-existing locale-based implementation.
