</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Utility class for formatting text for display in a potentially opposite-directionality context
 without garbling. The directionality of the context is set at formatter creation and the
 directionality of the text can be either estimated or passed in when known.

 &lt;p&gt;To support versions lower than {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#JELLY_BEAN_MR2},
 you can use the support library's {@link android.support.v4.text.BidiFormatter} class.

 &lt;p&gt;These APIs provides the following functionality:
 &lt;p&gt;
 1. Bidi Wrapping
 When text in one language is mixed into a document in another, opposite-directionality language,
 e.g. when an English business name is embedded in some Hebrew text, both the inserted string
 and the text surrounding it may be displayed incorrectly unless the inserted string is explicitly
 separated from the surrounding text in a &quot;wrapper&quot; that:
 &lt;p&gt;
 - Declares its directionality so that the string is displayed correctly. This can be done in
   Unicode bidi formatting codes by {@link #unicodeWrap} and similar methods.
 &lt;p&gt;
 - Isolates the string's directionality, so it does not unduly affect the surrounding content.
   Currently, this can only be done using invisible Unicode characters of the same direction as
   the context (LRM or RLM) in addition to the directionality declaration above, thus &quot;resetting&quot;
   the directionality to that of the context. The &quot;reset&quot; may need to be done at both ends of the
   string. Without &quot;reset&quot; after the string, the string will &quot;stick&quot; to a number or logically
   separate opposite-direction text that happens to follow it in-line (even if separated by
   neutral content like spaces and punctuation). Without &quot;reset&quot; before the string, the same can
   happen there, but only with more opposite-direction text, not a number. One approach is to
   &quot;reset&quot; the direction only after each string, on the theory that if the preceding opposite-
   direction text is itself bidi-wrapped, the &quot;reset&quot; after it will prevent the sticking. (Doing
   the &quot;reset&quot; only before each string definitely does not work because we do not want to require
   bidi-wrapping numbers, and a bidi-wrapped opposite-direction string could be followed by a
   number.) Still, the safest policy is to do the &quot;reset&quot; on both ends of each string, since RTL
   message translations often contain untranslated Latin-script brand names and technical terms,
   and one of these can be followed by a bidi-wrapped inserted value. On the other hand, when one
   has such a message, it is best to do the &quot;reset&quot; manually in the message translation itself,
   since the message's opposite-direction text could be followed by an inserted number, which we
   would not bidi-wrap anyway. Thus, &quot;reset&quot; only after the string is the current default. In an
   alternative to &quot;reset&quot;, recent additions to the HTML, CSS, and Unicode standards allow the
   isolation to be part of the directionality declaration. This form of isolation is better than
   &quot;reset&quot; because it takes less space, does not require knowing the context directionality, has a
   gentler effect than &quot;reset&quot;, and protects both ends of the string. However, we do not yet allow
   using it because required platforms do not yet support it.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Providing these wrapping services is the basic purpose of the bidi formatter.
 &lt;p&gt;
 2. Directionality estimation
 How does one know whether a string about to be inserted into surrounding text has the same
 directionality? Well, in many cases, one knows that this must be the case when writing the code
 doing the insertion, e.g. when a localized message is inserted into a localized page. In such
 cases there is no need to involve the bidi formatter at all. In some other cases, it need not be
 the same as the context, but is either constant (e.g. urls are always LTR) or otherwise known.
 In the remaining cases, e.g. when the string is user-entered or comes from a database, the
 language of the string (and thus its directionality) is not known a priori, and must be
 estimated at run-time. The bidi formatter can do this automatically using the default
 first-strong estimation algorithm. It can also be configured to use a custom directionality
 estimation object.

 &lt;p&gt;
 The algorithm: In case the given directionality doesn't match the context directionality, wraps
 the string with Unicode bidi formatting characters: RLE+{@code str}+PDF for RTL text, or
 LRE+{@code str}+PDF for LTR text.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If {@code isolate}, directionally isolates the string so that it does not garble its
 surroundings. Currently, this is done by &quot;resetting&quot; the directionality after the string by
 appending a trailing Unicode bidi mark matching the context directionality (LRM or RLM) when
 either the overall directionality or the exit directionality of the string is opposite to
 that of the context. Unless the formatter was built using
 {@link android.text.BidiFormatter.Builder#stereoReset(boolean)} with a {@code false} argument, also prepends a Unicode
 bidi mark matching the context directionality when either the overall directionality or the
 entry directionality of the string is opposite to that of the context. Note that as opposed
 to the overall directionality, the entry and exit directionalities are determined from the
 string itself.
