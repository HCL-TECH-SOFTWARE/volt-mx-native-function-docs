</span>@extends android.net.ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback

 A class that pins a process to the first network that satisfies a particular NetworkRequest.

 We use this to maintain compatibility with pre-M apps that call WifiManager.enableNetwork()
 to connect to a Wi-Fi network that has no Internet access, and then assume that they will be
 able to use that network because it's the system default.

 In order to maintain compatibility with apps that call setProcessDefaultNetwork themselves,
 we try not to set the default network unless they have already done so, and we try not to
 clear the default network unless we set it ourselves.

 This should maintain behaviour that's compatible with L, which would pin the whole system to
 any wifi network that was created via enableNetwork(..., true) until that network
 disconnected.

 Note that while this hack allows network traffic to flow, it is quite limited. For example:

 1. setProcessDefaultNetwork only affects this process, so:
    - Any subprocesses spawned by this process will not be pinned to Wi-Fi.
    - If this app relies on any other apps on the device also being on Wi-Fi, that won't work
      either, because other apps on the device will not be pinned.
 2. The behaviour of other APIs is not modified. For example:
    - getActiveNetworkInfo will return the system default network, not Wi-Fi.
    - There will be no CONNECTIVITY_ACTION broadcasts about TYPE_WIFI.
    - getProcessDefaultNetwork will not return null, so if any apps are relying on that, they
      will be surprised as well.

 This class is a per-process singleton because the process default network is a per-process
 singleton.
