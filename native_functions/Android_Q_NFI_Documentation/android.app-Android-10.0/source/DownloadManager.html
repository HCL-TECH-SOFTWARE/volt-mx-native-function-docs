 The download manager is a system service that handles long-running HTTP downloads. Clients may
 request that a URI be downloaded to a particular destination file. The download manager will
 conduct the download in the background, taking care of HTTP interactions and retrying downloads
 after failures or across connectivity changes and system reboots.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Apps that request downloads through this API should register a broadcast receiver for
 {@link #ACTION_NOTIFICATION_CLICKED} to appropriately handle when the user clicks on a running
 download in a notification or from the downloads UI.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Note that the application must have the {@link android.Manifest.permission#INTERNET}
 permission to use this class.
