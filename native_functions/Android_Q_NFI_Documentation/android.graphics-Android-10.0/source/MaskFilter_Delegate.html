 Delegate implementing the native methods of android.graphics.MaskFilter

 Through the layoutlib_create tool, the original native methods of MaskFilter have been replaced
 by calls to methods of the same name in this delegate class.

 This class behaves like the original native implementation, but in Java, keeping previously
 native data into its own objects and mapping them to int that are sent back and forth between
 it and the original MaskFilter class.

 This also serve as a base class for all MaskFilter delegate classes.
