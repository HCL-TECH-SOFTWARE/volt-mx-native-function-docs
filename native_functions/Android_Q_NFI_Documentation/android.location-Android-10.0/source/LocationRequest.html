</span> implements android.os.Parcelable

@extends java.lang.Object

 A data object that contains quality of service parameters for requests
 to the {@link android.location.LocationManager}.

 &lt;p&gt;LocationRequest objects are used to request a quality of service
 for location updates from the Location Manager.

 &lt;p&gt;For example, if your application wants high accuracy location
 it should create a location request with {@link #setQuality} set to
 {@link #ACCURACY_FINE} or {@link #POWER_HIGH}, and it should set
 {@link #setInterval} to less than one second. This would be
 appropriate for mapping applications that are showing your location
 in real-time.

 &lt;p&gt;At the other extreme, if you want negligible power
 impact, but to still receive location updates when available, then use
 {@link #setQuality} with {@link #POWER_NONE}. With this request your
 application will not trigger (and therefore will not receive any
 power blame) any location updates, but will receive locations
 triggered by other applications. This would be appropriate for
 applications that have no firm requirement for location, but can
 take advantage when available.

 &lt;p&gt;In between these two extremes is a very common use-case, where
 applications definitely want to receive
 updates at a specified interval, and can receive them faster when
 available, but still want a low power impact. These applications
 should consider {@link #POWER_LOW} combined with a faster
 {@link #setFastestInterval} (such as 1 minute) and a slower
 {@link #setInterval} (such as 60 minutes). They will only be assigned
 power blame for the interval set by {@link #setInterval}, but can
 still receive locations triggered by other applications at a rate up
 to {@link #setFastestInterval}. This style of request is appropriate for
 many location aware applications, including background usage. Do be
 careful to also throttle {@link #setFastestInterval} if you perform
 heavy-weight work after receiving an update - such as using the network.

 &lt;p&gt;Activities should strongly consider removing all location
 request when entering the background
 (for example at {@link android.app.Activity#onPause}), or
 at least swap the request to a larger interval and lower quality.
 Future version of the location manager may automatically perform background
 throttling on behalf of applications.

 &lt;p&gt;Applications cannot specify the exact location sources that are
 used by Android's &lt;em&gt;Fusion Engine&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, the system
 may have multiple location sources (providers) running and may
 fuse the results from several sources into a single Location object.

 &lt;p&gt;Location requests from applications with
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION} and not
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION} will
 be automatically throttled to a slower interval, and the location
 object will be obfuscated to only show a coarse level of accuracy.

 &lt;p&gt;All location requests are considered hints, and you may receive
 locations that are more accurate, less accurate, and slower
 than requested.

 updates can be controlled with {@link #setFastestInterval}.
