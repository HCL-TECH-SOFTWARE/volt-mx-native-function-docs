</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 A class for handling geocoding and reverse geocoding.  Geocoding is
 the process of transforming a street address or other description
 of a location into a (latitude, longitude) coordinate.  Reverse
 geocoding is the process of transforming a (latitude, longitude)
 coordinate into a (partial) address.  The amount of detail in a
 reverse geocoded location description may vary, for example one
 might contain the full street address of the closest building, while
 another might contain only a city name and postal code.

 The Geocoder class requires a backend service that is not included in
 the core android framework.  The Geocoder query methods will return an
 empty list if there no backend service in the platform.  Use the
 isPresent() method to determine whether a Geocoder implementation
 exists.
