</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Backs up cryptographic keys to remote secure hardware, encrypted with the user's lock screen.

 &lt;p&gt;A system app with the {@code android.permission.RECOVER_KEYSTORE} permission may generate or
 import recoverable keys using this class. To generate a key, the app must call
 {@link #generateKey}(String) with the desired alias for the key. This returns an AndroidKeyStore
 reference to a 256-bit {@link javax.crypto.SecretKey}, which can be used for AES/GCM/NoPadding.
 In order to get the same key again at a later time, the app can call {@link #getKey}(String) with
 the same alias. If a key is generated in this way the key's raw material is never directly
 exposed to the calling app. The system app may also import key material using
 {@link #importKey(String, byte[])}. The app may only generate and import keys for its own
 {@code uid}.

 &lt;p&gt;The same system app must also register a Recovery Agent to manage syncing recoverable keys to
 remote secure hardware. The Recovery Agent is a service that registers itself with the controller
 as follows:

 &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Invokes {@link #initRecoveryService(String, byte[], byte[])}
     &lt;ul&gt;
         &lt;li&gt;The first argument is the alias of the root certificate used to verify trusted
         hardware modules. Each trusted hardware module must have a public key signed with this
         root of trust. Roots of trust must be shipped with the framework. The app can list all
         valid roots of trust by calling {@link #getRootCertificates}().
         &lt;li&gt;The second argument is the UTF-8 bytes of the XML listing file. It lists the X509
         certificates containing the public keys of all available remote trusted hardware modules.
         Each of the X509 certificates can be validated against the chosen root of trust.
         &lt;li&gt;The third argument is the UTF-8 bytes of the XML signing file. The file contains a
         signature of the XML listing file. The signature can be validated against the chosen root
         of trust.
     &lt;/ul&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;This will cause the controller to choose a random public key from the list. From then
     on the controller will attempt to sync the key chain with the trusted hardware module to whom
     that key belongs.
     &lt;li&gt;Invokes {@link #setServerParams(byte[])} with a byte string that identifies the device
     to a remote server. This server may act as the front-end to the trusted hardware modules. It
     is up to the Recovery Agent to decide how best to identify devices, but this could be, e.g.,
     based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/instance-id/&quot;&gt;Instance ID&lt;/a&gt; of the
     system app.
     &lt;li&gt;Invokes {@link #setRecoverySecretTypes(int[])} with a list of types of secret used to
     secure the recoverable key chain. For now only
     {@link android.security.keystore.recovery.KeyChainProtectionParams#TYPE_LOCKSCREEN} is supported.
     &lt;li&gt;Invokes {@link #setSnapshotCreatedPendingIntent}(PendingIntent) with a
     {@link PendingIntent} that is to be invoked whenever a new snapshot is created. Although the
     controller can create snapshots without the Recovery Agent registering this intent, it is a
     good idea to register the intent so that the Recovery Agent is able to sync this snapshot to
     the trusted hardware module as soon as it is available.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The trusted hardware module's public key MUST be generated on secure hardware with protections
 equivalent to those described in the
 &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/preview/features/security/ckv-whitepaper.html&quot;&gt;Google
 Cloud Key Vault Service whitepaper&lt;/a&gt;. The trusted hardware module itself must protect the key
 chain from brute-forcing using the methods also described in the whitepaper: i.e., it should
 limit the number of allowed attempts to enter the lock screen. If the number of attempts is
 exceeded the key material must no longer be recoverable.

 &lt;p&gt;A recoverable key chain snapshot is considered pending if any of the following conditions
 are met:

 &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;The system app mutates the key chain. i.e., generates, imports, or removes a key.
     &lt;li&gt;The user changes their lock screen.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Whenever the user unlocks their device, if a snapshot is pending, the Recovery Controller
 generates a new snapshot. It follows these steps to do so:

 &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Generates a 256-bit AES key using {@link java.security.SecureRandom}. This is the
     Recovery Key.
     &lt;li&gt;Wraps the key material of all keys in the recoverable key chain with the Recovery Key.
     &lt;li&gt;Encrypts the Recovery Key with both the public key of the trusted hardware module and a
     symmetric key derived from the user's lock screen.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The controller then writes this snapshot to disk, and uses the {@link PendingIntent} that was
 set by the Recovery Agent during initialization to inform it that a new snapshot is available.
 The snapshot only contains keys for that Recovery Agent's {@code uid} - i.e., keys the agent's
 app itself generated. If multiple Recovery Agents exist on the device, each will be notified of
 their new snapshots, and each snapshots' keys will be only those belonging to the same
 {@code uid}.

 &lt;p&gt;The Recovery Agent retrieves its most recent snapshot by calling
 {@link #getKeyChainSnapshot}(). It syncs the snapshot to the remote server. The snapshot contains
 the public key used for encryption, which the server uses to forward the encrypted recovery key
 to the correct trusted hardware module. The snapshot also contains the server params, which are
 used to identify this device to the server.

 &lt;p&gt;The client uses the server params to identify a device whose key chain it wishes to restore.
 This may be on a different device to the device that originally synced the key chain. The client
 sends the server params identifying the previous device to the server. The server returns the
 X509 certificate identifying the trusted hardware module in which the encrypted Recovery Key is
 stored. It also returns some vault parameters identifying that particular Recovery Key to the
 trusted hardware module. And it also returns a vault challenge, which is used as part of the
 vault opening protocol to ensure the recovery claim is fresh. See the whitepaper for more
 details.

 &lt;p&gt;The key chain is recovered via a {@link android.security.keystore.recovery.RecoverySession}. A Recovery Agent creates one by
 invoking {@link #createRecoverySession}(). It then invokes
 {@link android.security.keystore.recovery.RecoverySession#start(String, CertPath, byte[], byte[], List)} with these arguments:

 &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;The alias of the root of trust used to verify the trusted hardware module.
     &lt;li&gt;The X509 certificate of the trusted hardware module.
     &lt;li&gt;The vault parameters used to identify the Recovery Key to the trusted hardware module.
     &lt;li&gt;The vault challenge, as issued by the trusted hardware module.
     &lt;li&gt;A list of secrets, corresponding to the secrets used to protect the key chain. At the
     moment this is a single {@link android.security.keystore.recovery.KeyChainProtectionParams} containing the lock screen of the
     device whose key chain is to be recovered.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This method returns a byte array containing the Recovery Claim, which can be issued to the
 remote trusted hardware module. It is encrypted with the trusted hardware module's public key
 (which has itself been certified with the root of trust). It also contains an ephemeral symmetric
 key generated for this recovery session, which the remote trusted hardware module uses to encrypt
 its responses. This is the Session Key.

 &lt;p&gt;If the lock screen provided is correct, the remote trusted hardware module decrypts one of the
 layers of lock-screen encryption from the Recovery Key. It then returns this key, encrypted with
 the Session Key to the Recovery Agent. As the Recovery Agent does not know the Session Key, it
 must then invoke {@link android.security.keystore.recovery.RecoverySession#recoverKeyChainSnapshot(byte[], List)} with the encrypted
 Recovery Key and the list of wrapped application keys. The controller then decrypts the layer of
 encryption provided by the Session Key, and uses the lock screen to decrypt the final layer of
 encryption. It then uses the Recovery Key to decrypt all of the wrapped application keys, and
 imports them into its own KeyStore. The Recovery Agent's app may then access these keys by
 calling {@link #getKey}(String). Only this app's {@code uid} may access the keys that have been
 recovered.
