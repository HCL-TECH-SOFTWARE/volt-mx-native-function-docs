 Constants for intents related to showing speech recognition results.
 
 These constants should not be needed for normal utilization of speech recognition. They
 would only be called if you wanted to trigger a view of voice search results in your
 application, or implemented if you wanted to offer a different view for voice search results
 with your application.
 
 The standard behavior here for someone receiving an {@link #ACTION_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULTS} is to
 first retrieve the list of {@link #EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_STRINGS}, and use any provided
 HTML for that result in {@link #EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_HTML}, if available, to display
 the search results. If that is not available, then the corresponding url for that result in
 {@link #EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_URLS} should be used. And if even that is not available,
 then a search url should be constructed from the actual recognition result string.

<span id='android-speech-RecognizerResultsIntent-property-ACTION_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULTS'>/** Intent that can be sent by implementations of voice search to display the results of
</span> a search in, for example, a web browser.
 
 This intent should always be accompanied by at least
 {@link #EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_STRINGS}, and optionally but recommended,
 {@link #EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_URLS}, and sometimes
 {@link #EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_HTML} and
 {@link #EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_HTML_BASE_URLS}.
 
 These are parallel arrays, where a recognition result string at index N of
 {@link #EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_STRINGS} should be accompanied by a url to use for
 searching based on that string at index N of {@link #EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_URLS},
 and, possibly, the full html to display for that result at index N of
 {@link #EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_HTML}. If full html is provided, a base url (or
 list of base urls) should be provided with {@link #EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_HTML_BASE_URLS}.

 search url, that entry in this ArrayList should be &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, and the implementor of

 its own choosing, based on the recognition result string.
 
 Currently this html content should be expected in the form of a uri with scheme
 {@link #URI_SCHEME_INLINE} for the Browser. In the future this may change to a &quot;content://&quot;
 uri or some other identifier. Anyone who reads this extra should confirm that a result is
 in fact an &quot;inline:&quot; uri and back off to the urls or strings gracefully if it is not, thus
 maintaining future backwards compatibility if this changes.
