 Indicates that the key can no longer be used because it has been permanently invalidated.

 &lt;p&gt;This only occurs for keys which are authorized to be used only if the user has been
 authenticated. Such keys are permanently and irreversibly invalidated once the secure lock screen
 is disabled (i.e., reconfigured to None, Swipe or other mode which does not authenticate the
 user) or when the secure lock screen is forcibly reset (e.g., by Device Admin). Additionally,
 keys configured to require user authentication to take place for every of the keys, are also
 permanently invalidated once a new fingerprint is enrolled or once no more fingerprints are
 enrolled.
