</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 A wrapper that encapsulates an outbound call from the system process, converting an asynchronous
 operation into a synchronous operation with time-out and cancellation built-in. This was built to
 be able to call one-way binder methods that accept a {@link IBackupCallback} as a callback and
 handle the result inline.

 &lt;p&gt;Create one {@link com.android.server.backup.remote.RemoteCall} object providing the actual call in the form of a {@link com.android.server.backup.remote.RemoteCallable} that accepts a {@link IBackupCallback}. Perform the call by calling {@link #call}(), at which point {@link com.android.server.backup.remote.RemoteCall} will execute the callable providing an implementation
 of the callback that communicates the result back to this object. Even if the call returns
 straight away (which is the case for one-way methods) the method will only return when either the
 callback is called, time-out happens, or someone calls {@link #cancel}().

 &lt;p&gt;This class was designed to have the method {@link #call}() called only once.
