</span>@extends java.util.concurrent.AbstractExecutorService

 An {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService} for running {@link java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask}s.
 A {@code ForkJoinPool} provides the entry point for submissions
 from non-{@code ForkJoinTask} clients, as well as management and
 monitoring operations.

 &lt;p&gt;A {@code ForkJoinPool} differs from other kinds of {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService} mainly by virtue of employing
 &lt;em&gt;work-stealing&lt;/em&gt;: all threads in the pool attempt to find and
 execute tasks submitted to the pool and/or created by other active
 tasks (eventually blocking waiting for work if none exist). This
 enables efficient processing when most tasks spawn other subtasks
 (as do most {@code ForkJoinTask}s), as well as when many small
 tasks are submitted to the pool from external clients.  Especially
 when setting &lt;em&gt;asyncMode&lt;/em&gt; to true in constructors, {@code
 ForkJoinPool}s may also be appropriate for use with event-style
 tasks that are never joined.

 &lt;p&gt;A static {@link #commonPool}() is available and appropriate for
 most applications. The common pool is used by any ForkJoinTask that
 is not explicitly submitted to a specified pool. Using the common
 pool normally reduces resource usage (its threads are slowly
 reclaimed during periods of non-use, and reinstated upon subsequent
 use).

 &lt;p&gt;For applications that require separate or custom pools, a {@code
 ForkJoinPool} may be constructed with a given target parallelism
 level; by default, equal to the number of available processors.
 The pool attempts to maintain enough active (or available) threads
 by dynamically adding, suspending, or resuming internal worker
 threads, even if some tasks are stalled waiting to join others.
 However, no such adjustments are guaranteed in the face of blocked
 I/O or other unmanaged synchronization. The nested {@link java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker} interface enables extension of the kinds of
 synchronization accommodated.

 &lt;p&gt;In addition to execution and lifecycle control methods, this
 class provides status check methods (for example
 {@link #getStealCount}) that are intended to aid in developing,
 tuning, and monitoring fork/join applications. Also, method
 {@link #toString} returns indications of pool state in a
 convenient form for informal monitoring.

 &lt;p&gt;As is the case with other ExecutorServices, there are three
 main task execution methods summarized in the following table.
 These are designed to be used primarily by clients not already
 engaged in fork/join computations in the current pool.  The main
 forms of these methods accept instances of {@code ForkJoinTask},
 but overloaded forms also allow mixed execution of plain {@code
 Runnable}- or {@code Callable}- based activities as well.  However,
 tasks that are already executing in a pool should normally instead
 use the within-computation forms listed in the table unless using
 async event-style tasks that are not usually joined, in which case
 there is little difference among choice of methods.

 &lt;table BORDER CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=1&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td ALIGN=CENTER&gt; &lt;b&gt;Call from non-fork/join clients&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td ALIGN=CENTER&gt; &lt;b&gt;Call from within fork/join computations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; &lt;b&gt;Arrange async execution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; {@link #execute}(ForkJoinTask)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; {@link java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask#fork}&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; &lt;b&gt;Await and obtain result&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; {@link #invoke}(ForkJoinTask)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; {@link java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask#invoke}&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; &lt;b&gt;Arrange exec and obtain Future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; {@link #submit}(ForkJoinTask)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; {@link java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask#fork} (ForkJoinTasks &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; Futures)&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The common pool is by default constructed with default
 parameters, but these may be controlled by setting three
 {@linkplain System#getProperty system properties}:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@code java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism}
 - the parallelism level, a non-negative integer
 &lt;li&gt;{@code java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.threadFactory}
 - the class name of a {@link java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.ForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory}
 &lt;li&gt;{@code java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.exceptionHandler}
 - the class name of a {@link UncaughtExceptionHandler}
 &lt;li&gt;{@code java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.maximumSpares}
 - the maximum number of allowed extra threads to maintain target
 parallelism (default 256).
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 If a {@link SecurityManager} is present and no factory is
 specified, then the default pool uses a factory supplying
 threads that have no {@link Permissions} enabled.
 The system class loader is used to load these classes.
 Upon any error in establishing these settings, default parameters
 are used. It is possible to disable or limit the use of threads in
 the common pool by setting the parallelism property to zero, and/or
 using a factory that may return {@code null}. However doing so may
 cause unjoined tasks to never be executed.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Implementation notes&lt;/b&gt;: This implementation restricts the
 maximum number of running threads to 32767. Attempts to create
 pools with greater than the maximum number result in
 {@code IllegalArgumentException}.

 &lt;p&gt;This implementation rejects submitted tasks (that is, by throwing
 {@link java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException}) only when the pool is shut down
 or internal resources have been exhausted.
