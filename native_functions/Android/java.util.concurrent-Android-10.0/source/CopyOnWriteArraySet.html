</span> implements java.io.Serializable

@extends java.util.AbstractSet

 A {@link java.util.Set} that uses an internal {@link java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList}
 for all of its operations.  Thus, it shares the same basic properties:
 &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is best suited for applications in which set sizes generally
       stay small, read-only operations
       vastly outnumber mutative operations, and you need
       to prevent interference among threads during traversal.
  &lt;li&gt;It is thread-safe.
  &lt;li&gt;Mutative operations ({@code add}, {@code set}, {@code remove}, etc.)
      are expensive since they usually entail copying the entire underlying
      array.
  &lt;li&gt;Iterators do not support the mutative {@code remove} operation.
  &lt;li&gt;Traversal via iterators is fast and cannot encounter
      interference from other threads. Iterators rely on
      unchanging snapshots of the array at the time the iterators were
      constructed.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample Usage.&lt;/b&gt; The following code sketch uses a
 copy-on-write set to maintain a set of Handler objects that
 perform some action upon state updates.

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class Handler { void handle(); ... }

 class X {
   private final CopyOnWriteArraySet&lt;Handler&gt; handlers
     = new CopyOnWriteArraySet&lt;&gt;();
   public void addHandler(Handler h) { handlers.add(h); }

   private long internalState;
   private synchronized void changeState() { internalState = ...; }

   public void update() {
     changeState();
     for (Handler handler : handlers)
       handler.handle();
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The returned array will be &quot;safe&quot; in that no references to it
 are maintained by this set.  (In other words, this method must
 allocate a new array even if this set is backed by an array).
 The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

 &lt;p&gt;This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
 APIs.

<span id='java-util-concurrent-CopyOnWriteArraySet-method-toArray'>/**Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set; the
</span> runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.
 If the set fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
 Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the
 specified array and the size of this set.

 &lt;p&gt;If this set fits in the specified array with room to spare
 (i.e., the array has more elements than this set), the element in
 the array immediately following the end of the set is set to
 {@code null}.  (This is useful in determining the length of this
 set &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; if the caller knows that this set does not contain
 any null elements.)

 &lt;p&gt;If this set makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
 are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements
 in the same order.

 &lt;p&gt;Like the {@link #toArray}() method, this method acts as bridge between
 array-based and collection-based APIs.  Further, this method allows
 precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
 under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

 &lt;p&gt;Suppose {@code x} is a set known to contain only strings.
 The following code can be used to dump the set into a newly allocated
 array of {@code String}:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);}&lt;/pre&gt;

 Note that {@code toArray(new Object[0])} is identical in function to
 {@code toArray()}.
@param {Object {java.lang.Object[]}} a the array into which the elements of this set are to be
