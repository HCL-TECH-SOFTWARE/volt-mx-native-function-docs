</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 A synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until
 a set of operations being performed in other threads completes.

 &lt;p&gt;A {@code CountDownLatch} is initialized with a given &lt;em&gt;count&lt;/em&gt;.
 The {@link #await await} methods block until the current count reaches
 zero due to invocations of the {@link #countDown} method, after which
 all waiting threads are released and any subsequent invocations of
 {@link #await await} return immediately.  This is a one-shot phenomenon
 -- the count cannot be reset.  If you need a version that resets the
 count, consider using a {@link java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier}.

 &lt;p&gt;A {@code CountDownLatch} is a versatile synchronization tool
 and can be used for a number of purposes.  A
 {@code CountDownLatch} initialized with a count of one serves as a
 simple on/off latch, or gate: all threads invoking {@link #await await}
 wait at the gate until it is opened by a thread invoking {@link #countDown}.  A {@code CountDownLatch} initialized to &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;
 can be used to make one thread wait until &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; threads have
 completed some action, or some action has been completed N times.

 &lt;p&gt;A useful property of a {@code CountDownLatch} is that it
 doesn't require that threads calling {@code countDown} wait for
 the count to reach zero before proceeding, it simply prevents any
 thread from proceeding past an {@link #await await} until all
 threads could pass.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample usage:&lt;/b&gt; Here is a pair of classes in which a group
 of worker threads use two countdown latches:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The first is a start signal that prevents any worker from proceeding
 until the driver is ready for them to proceed;
 &lt;li&gt;The second is a completion signal that allows the driver to wait
 until all workers have completed.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class Driver { // ...
   void main() throws InterruptedException {
     CountDownLatch startSignal = new CountDownLatch(1);
     CountDownLatch doneSignal = new CountDownLatch(N);

     for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i) // create and start threads
       new Thread(new Worker(startSignal, doneSignal)).start();

     doSomethingElse();            // don't let run yet
     startSignal.countDown();      // let all threads proceed
     doSomethingElse();
     doneSignal.await();           // wait for all to finish
   }
 }

 class Worker implements Runnable {
   private final CountDownLatch startSignal;
   private final CountDownLatch doneSignal;
   Worker(CountDownLatch startSignal, CountDownLatch doneSignal) {
     this.startSignal = startSignal;
     this.doneSignal = doneSignal;
   }
   public void run() {
     try {
       startSignal.await();
       doWork();
       doneSignal.countDown();
     } catch (InterruptedException ex) {} // return;
   }

   void doWork() { ... }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Another typical usage would be to divide a problem into N parts,
 describe each part with a Runnable that executes that portion and
 counts down on the latch, and queue all the Runnables to an
 Executor.  When all sub-parts are complete, the coordinating thread
 will be able to pass through await. (When threads must repeatedly
 count down in this way, instead use a {@link java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier}.)

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class Driver2 { // ...
   void main() throws InterruptedException {
     CountDownLatch doneSignal = new CountDownLatch(N);
     Executor e = ...

     for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i) // create and start threads
       e.execute(new WorkerRunnable(doneSignal, i));

     doneSignal.await();           // wait for all to finish
   }
 }

 class WorkerRunnable implements Runnable {
   private final CountDownLatch doneSignal;
   private final int i;
   WorkerRunnable(CountDownLatch doneSignal, int i) {
     this.doneSignal = doneSignal;
     this.i = i;
   }
   public void run() {
     try {
       doWork(i);
       doneSignal.countDown();
     } catch (InterruptedException ex) {} // return;
   }

   void doWork() { ... }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Memory consistency effects: Until the count reaches
 zero, actions in a thread prior to calling
 {@code countDown()}
 &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 actions following a successful return from a corresponding
 {@code await()} in another thread.
