</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 A synchronization point at which threads can pair and swap elements
 within pairs.  Each thread presents some object on entry to the
 {@link #exchange exchange} method, matches with a partner thread,
 and receives its partner's object on return.  An Exchanger may be
 viewed as a bidirectional form of a {@link java.util.concurrent.SynchronousQueue}.
 Exchangers may be useful in applications such as genetic algorithms
 and pipeline designs.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample Usage:&lt;/b&gt;
 Here are the highlights of a class that uses an {@code Exchanger}
 to swap buffers between threads so that the thread filling the
 buffer gets a freshly emptied one when it needs it, handing off the
 filled one to the thread emptying the buffer.
 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class FillAndEmpty {
   Exchanger&lt;DataBuffer&gt; exchanger = new Exchanger&lt;&gt;();
   DataBuffer initialEmptyBuffer = ... a made-up type
   DataBuffer initialFullBuffer = ...

   class FillingLoop implements Runnable {
     public void run() {
       DataBuffer currentBuffer = initialEmptyBuffer;
       try {
         while (currentBuffer != null) {
           addToBuffer(currentBuffer);
           if (currentBuffer.isFull())
             currentBuffer = exchanger.exchange(currentBuffer);
         }
       } catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ... }
     }
   }

   class EmptyingLoop implements Runnable {
     public void run() {
       DataBuffer currentBuffer = initialFullBuffer;
       try {
         while (currentBuffer != null) {
           takeFromBuffer(currentBuffer);
           if (currentBuffer.isEmpty())
             currentBuffer = exchanger.exchange(currentBuffer);
         }
       } catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}
     }
   }

   void start() {
     new Thread(new FillingLoop()).start();
     new Thread(new EmptyingLoop()).start();
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Memory consistency effects: For each pair of threads that
 successfully exchange objects via an {@code Exchanger}, actions
 prior to the {@code exchange()} in each thread
 &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 those subsequent to a return from the corresponding {@code exchange()}
 in the other thread.
