  <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span id='java-util-concurrent-Executor'>/**@class java.util.concurrent.Executor
</span> An object that executes submitted {@link Runnable} tasks. This
 interface provides a way of decoupling task submission from the
 mechanics of how each task will be run, including details of thread
 use, scheduling, etc.  An {@code Executor} is normally used
 instead of explicitly creating threads. For example, rather than
 invoking {@code new Thread(new RunnableTask()).start()} for each
 of a set of tasks, you might use:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 Executor executor = anExecutor();
 executor.execute(new RunnableTask1());
 executor.execute(new RunnableTask2());
 ...}&lt;/pre&gt;

 However, the {@code Executor} interface does not strictly require
 that execution be asynchronous. In the simplest case, an executor
 can run the submitted task immediately in the caller's thread:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class DirectExecutor implements Executor {
   public void execute(Runnable r) {
     r.run();
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 More typically, tasks are executed in some thread other than the
 caller's thread.  The executor below spawns a new thread for each
 task.

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class ThreadPerTaskExecutor implements Executor {
   public void execute(Runnable r) {
     new Thread(r).start();
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 Many {@code Executor} implementations impose some sort of
 limitation on how and when tasks are scheduled.  The executor below
 serializes the submission of tasks to a second executor,
 illustrating a composite executor.

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class SerialExecutor implements Executor {
   final Queue&lt;Runnable&gt; tasks = new ArrayDeque&lt;&gt;();
   final Executor executor;
   Runnable active;

   SerialExecutor(Executor executor) {
     this.executor = executor;
   }

   public synchronized void execute(final Runnable r) {
     tasks.add(new Runnable() {
       public void run() {
         try {
           r.run();
         } finally {
           scheduleNext();
         }
       }
     });
     if (active == null) {
       scheduleNext();
     }
   }

   protected synchronized void scheduleNext() {
     if ((active = tasks.poll()) != null) {
       executor.execute(active);
     }
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 The {@code Executor} implementations provided in this package
 implement {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService}, which is a more extensive
 interface.  The {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor} class provides an
 extensible thread pool implementation. The {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors} class
 provides convenient factory methods for these Executors.

 &lt;p&gt;Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to
 submitting a {@code Runnable} object to an {@code Executor}
 &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 its execution begins, perhaps in another thread.
