</span> A service that decouples the production of new asynchronous tasks
 from the consumption of the results of completed tasks.  Producers
 {@code submit} tasks for execution. Consumers {@code take}
 completed tasks and process their results in the order they
 complete.  A {@code CompletionService} can for example be used to
 manage asynchronous I/O, in which tasks that perform reads are
 submitted in one part of a program or system, and then acted upon
 in a different part of the program when the reads complete,
 possibly in a different order than they were requested.

 &lt;p&gt;Typically, a {@code CompletionService} relies on a separate
 {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor} to actually execute the tasks, in which case the
 {@code CompletionService} only manages an internal completion
 queue. The {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorCompletionService} class provides an
 implementation of this approach.

 &lt;p&gt;Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to
 submitting a task to a {@code CompletionService}
 &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 actions taken by that task, which in turn &lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt;
 actions following a successful return from the corresponding {@code take()}.
