</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 A reusable synchronization barrier, similar in functionality to
 {@link java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier CyclicBarrier} and
 {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch CountDownLatch}
 but supporting more flexible usage.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Registration.&lt;/b&gt; Unlike the case for other barriers, the
 number of parties &lt;em&gt;registered&lt;/em&gt; to synchronize on a phaser
 may vary over time.  Tasks may be registered at any time (using
 methods {@link #register}, {@link #bulkRegister}, or forms of
 constructors establishing initial numbers of parties), and
 optionally deregistered upon any arrival (using {@link #arriveAndDeregister}).  As is the case with most basic
 synchronization constructs, registration and deregistration affect
 only internal counts; they do not establish any further internal
 bookkeeping, so tasks cannot query whether they are registered.
 (However, you can introduce such bookkeeping by subclassing this
 class.)

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synchronization.&lt;/b&gt; Like a {@code CyclicBarrier}, a {@code
 Phaser} may be repeatedly awaited.  Method {@link #arriveAndAwaitAdvance} has effect analogous to {@link java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier#await CyclicBarrier.await}. Each
 generation of a phaser has an associated phase number. The phase
 number starts at zero, and advances when all parties arrive at the
 phaser, wrapping around to zero after reaching {@code
 Integer.MAX_VALUE}. The use of phase numbers enables independent
 control of actions upon arrival at a phaser and upon awaiting
 others, via two kinds of methods that may be invoked by any
 registered party:

 &lt;ul&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Arrival.&lt;/b&gt; Methods {@link #arrive} and
       {@link #arriveAndDeregister} record arrival.  These methods
       do not block, but return an associated &lt;em&gt;arrival phase
       number&lt;/em&gt;; that is, the phase number of the phaser to which
       the arrival applied. When the final party for a given phase
       arrives, an optional action is performed and the phase
       advances.  These actions are performed by the party
       triggering a phase advance, and are arranged by overriding
       method {@link #onAdvance(int, int)}, which also controls
       termination. Overriding this method is similar to, but more
       flexible than, providing a barrier action to a {@code
       CyclicBarrier}.

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Waiting.&lt;/b&gt; Method {@link #awaitAdvance} requires an
       argument indicating an arrival phase number, and returns when
       the phaser advances to (or is already at) a different phase.
       Unlike similar constructions using {@code CyclicBarrier},
       method {@code awaitAdvance} continues to wait even if the
       waiting thread is interrupted. Interruptible and timeout
       versions are also available, but exceptions encountered while
       tasks wait interruptibly or with timeout do not change the
       state of the phaser. If necessary, you can perform any
       associated recovery within handlers of those exceptions,
       often after invoking {@code forceTermination}.  Phasers may
       also be used by tasks executing in a {@link java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool}.
       Progress is ensured if the pool's parallelismLevel can
       accommodate the maximum number of simultaneously blocked
       parties.

 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Termination.&lt;/b&gt; A phaser may enter a &lt;em&gt;termination&lt;/em&gt;
 state, that may be checked using method {@link #isTerminated}. Upon
 termination, all synchronization methods immediately return without
 waiting for advance, as indicated by a negative return value.
 Similarly, attempts to register upon termination have no effect.
 Termination is triggered when an invocation of {@code onAdvance}
 returns {@code true}. The default implementation returns {@code
 true} if a deregistration has caused the number of registered
 parties to become zero.  As illustrated below, when phasers control
 actions with a fixed number of iterations, it is often convenient
 to override this method to cause termination when the current phase
 number reaches a threshold. Method {@link #forceTermination} is
 also available to abruptly release waiting threads and allow them
 to terminate.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tiering.&lt;/b&gt; Phasers may be &lt;em&gt;tiered&lt;/em&gt; (i.e.,
 constructed in tree structures) to reduce contention. Phasers with
 large numbers of parties that would otherwise experience heavy
 synchronization contention costs may instead be set up so that
 groups of sub-phasers share a common parent.  This may greatly
 increase throughput even though it incurs greater per-operation
 overhead.

 &lt;p&gt;In a tree of tiered phasers, registration and deregistration of
 child phasers with their parent are managed automatically.
 Whenever the number of registered parties of a child phaser becomes
 non-zero (as established in the {@link #Phaser(Phaser,int)}
 constructor, {@link #register}, or {@link #bulkRegister}), the
 child phaser is registered with its parent.  Whenever the number of
 registered parties becomes zero as the result of an invocation of
 {@link #arriveAndDeregister}, the child phaser is deregistered
 from its parent.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monitoring.&lt;/b&gt; While synchronization methods may be invoked
 only by registered parties, the current state of a phaser may be
 monitored by any caller.  At any given moment there are {@link #getRegisteredParties} parties in total, of which {@link #getArrivedParties} have arrived at the current phase ({@link #getPhase}).  When the remaining ({@link #getUnarrivedParties})
 parties arrive, the phase advances.  The values returned by these
 methods may reflect transient states and so are not in general
 useful for synchronization control.  Method {@link #toString}
 returns snapshots of these state queries in a form convenient for
 informal monitoring.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample usages:&lt;/b&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A {@code Phaser} may be used instead of a {@code CountDownLatch}
 to control a one-shot action serving a variable number of parties.
 The typical idiom is for the method setting this up to first
 register, then start the actions, then deregister, as in:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 void runTasks(List&lt;Runnable&gt; tasks) {
   final Phaser phaser = new Phaser(1); // &quot;1&quot; to register self
   // create and start threads
   for (final Runnable task : tasks) {
     phaser.register();
     new Thread() {
       public void run() {
         phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance(); // await all creation
         task.run();
       }
     }.start();
   }

   // allow threads to start and deregister self
   phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;One way to cause a set of threads to repeatedly perform actions
 for a given number of iterations is to override {@code onAdvance}:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 void startTasks(List&lt;Runnable&gt; tasks, final int iterations) {
   final Phaser phaser = new Phaser() {
     protected boolean onAdvance(int phase, int registeredParties) {
       return phase &gt;= iterations || registeredParties == 0;
     }
   };
   phaser.register();
   for (final Runnable task : tasks) {
     phaser.register();
     new Thread() {
       public void run() {
         do {
           task.run();
           phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
         } while (!phaser.isTerminated());
       }
     }.start();
   }
   phaser.arriveAndDeregister(); // deregister self, don't wait
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 If the main task must later await termination, it
 may re-register and then execute a similar loop:
 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
   // ...
   phaser.register();
   while (!phaser.isTerminated())
     phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();}&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Related constructions may be used to await particular phase numbers
 in contexts where you are sure that the phase will never wrap around
 {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}. For example:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 void awaitPhase(Phaser phaser, int phase) {
   int p = phaser.register(); // assumes caller not already registered
   while (p &lt; phase) {
     if (phaser.isTerminated())
       // ... deal with unexpected termination
     else
       p = phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
   }
   phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;


 &lt;p&gt;To create a set of {@code n} tasks using a tree of phasers, you
 could use code of the following form, assuming a Task class with a
 constructor accepting a {@code Phaser} that it registers with upon
 construction. After invocation of {@code build(new Task[n], 0, n,
 new Phaser())}, these tasks could then be started, for example by
 submitting to a pool:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 void build(Task[] tasks, int lo, int hi, Phaser ph) {
   if (hi - lo &gt; TASKS_PER_PHASER) {
     for (int i = lo; i &lt; hi; i += TASKS_PER_PHASER) {
       int j = Math.min(i + TASKS_PER_PHASER, hi);
       build(tasks, i, j, new Phaser(ph));
     }
   } else {
     for (int i = lo; i &lt; hi; ++i)
       tasks[i] = new Task(ph);
       // assumes new Task(ph) performs ph.register()
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 The best value of {@code TASKS_PER_PHASER} depends mainly on
 expected synchronization rates. A value as low as four may
 be appropriate for extremely small per-phase task bodies (thus
 high rates), or up to hundreds for extremely large ones.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Implementation notes&lt;/b&gt;: This implementation restricts the
 maximum number of parties to 65535. Attempts to register additional
 parties result in {@code IllegalStateException}. However, you can and
 should create tiered phasers to accommodate arbitrarily large sets
 of participants.
