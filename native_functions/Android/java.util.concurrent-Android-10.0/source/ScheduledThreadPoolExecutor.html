</span> implements java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService

@extends java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor

 A {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor} that can additionally schedule
 commands to run after a given delay, or to execute periodically.
 This class is preferable to {@link java.util.Timer} when multiple
 worker threads are needed, or when the additional flexibility or
 capabilities of {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor} (which this class
 extends) are required.

 &lt;p&gt;Delayed tasks execute no sooner than they are enabled, but
 without any real-time guarantees about when, after they are
 enabled, they will commence. Tasks scheduled for exactly the same
 execution time are enabled in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order of
 submission.

 &lt;p&gt;When a submitted task is cancelled before it is run, execution
 is suppressed.  By default, such a cancelled task is not
 automatically removed from the work queue until its delay elapses.
 While this enables further inspection and monitoring, it may also
 cause unbounded retention of cancelled tasks.

 &lt;p&gt;Successive executions of a periodic task scheduled via
 {@link #scheduleAtFixedRate scheduleAtFixedRate} or
 {@link #scheduleWithFixedDelay scheduleWithFixedDelay}
 do not overlap. While different executions may be performed by
 different threads, the effects of prior executions
 &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 those of subsequent ones.

 &lt;p&gt;While this class inherits from {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor}, a few
 of the inherited tuning methods are not useful for it. In
 particular, because it acts as a fixed-sized pool using
 {@code corePoolSize} threads and an unbounded queue, adjustments
 to {@code maximumPoolSize} have no useful effect. Additionally, it
 is almost never a good idea to set {@code corePoolSize} to zero or
 use {@code allowCoreThreadTimeOut} because this may leave the pool
 without threads to handle tasks once they become eligible to run.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Extension notes:&lt;/b&gt; This class overrides the
 {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor#execute(Runnable) execute} and
 {@link java.util.concurrent.AbstractExecutorService#submit(Runnable) submit}
 methods to generate internal {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledFuture} objects to
 control per-task delays and scheduling.  To preserve
 functionality, any further overrides of these methods in
 subclasses must invoke superclass versions, which effectively
 disables additional task customization.  However, this class
 provides alternative protected extension method
 {@code decorateTask} (one version each for {@code Runnable} and
 {@code Callable}) that can be used to customize the concrete task
 types used to execute commands entered via {@code execute},
 {@code submit}, {@code schedule}, {@code scheduleAtFixedRate},
 and {@code scheduleWithFixedDelay}.  By default, a
 {@code ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} uses a task type extending
 {@link java.util.concurrent.FutureTask}. However, this may be modified or replaced using
 subclasses of the form:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 public class CustomScheduledExecutor extends ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor {

   static class CustomTask&lt;V&gt; implements RunnableScheduledFuture&lt;V&gt; { ... }

   protected &lt;V&gt; RunnableScheduledFuture&lt;V&gt; decorateTask(
                Runnable r, RunnableScheduledFuture&lt;V&gt; task) {
       return new CustomTask&lt;V&gt;(r, task);
   }

   protected &lt;V&gt; RunnableScheduledFuture&lt;V&gt; decorateTask(
                Callable&lt;V&gt; c, RunnableScheduledFuture&lt;V&gt; task) {
       return new CustomTask&lt;V&gt;(c, task);
   }
   // ... add constructors, etc.
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;
