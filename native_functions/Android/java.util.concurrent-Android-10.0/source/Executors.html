</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Factory and utility methods for {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor}, {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService}, {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService}, {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory}, and {@link java.util.concurrent.Callable} classes defined in this
 package. This class supports the following kinds of methods:

 &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Methods that create and return an {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService}
       set up with commonly useful configuration settings.
   &lt;li&gt;Methods that create and return a {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService}
       set up with commonly useful configuration settings.
   &lt;li&gt;Methods that create and return a &quot;wrapped&quot; ExecutorService, that
       disables reconfiguration by making implementation-specific methods
       inaccessible.
   &lt;li&gt;Methods that create and return a {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory}
       that sets newly created threads to a known state.
   &lt;li&gt;Methods that create and return a {@link java.util.concurrent.Callable}
       out of other closure-like forms, so they can be used
       in execution methods requiring {@code Callable}.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
