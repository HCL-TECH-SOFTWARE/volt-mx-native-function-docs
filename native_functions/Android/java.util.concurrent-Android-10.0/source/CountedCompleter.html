</span>@extends java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask

 A {@link java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask} with a completion action performed when
 triggered and there are no remaining pending actions.
 CountedCompleters are in general more robust in the
 presence of subtask stalls and blockage than are other forms of
 ForkJoinTasks, but are less intuitive to program.  Uses of
 CountedCompleter are similar to those of other completion based
 components (such as {@link java.nio.channels.CompletionHandler})
 except that multiple &lt;em&gt;pending&lt;/em&gt; completions may be necessary
 to trigger the completion action {@link #onCompletion}(CountedCompleter),
 not just one.
 Unless initialized otherwise, the {@linkplain #getPendingCount pending
 count} starts at zero, but may be (atomically) changed using
 methods {@link #setPendingCount}, {@link #addToPendingCount}, and
 {@link #compareAndSetPendingCount}. Upon invocation of {@link #tryComplete}, if the pending action count is nonzero, it is
 decremented; otherwise, the completion action is performed, and if
 this completer itself has a completer, the process is continued
 with its completer.  As is the case with related synchronization
 components such as {@link java.util.concurrent.Phaser Phaser} and
 {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore Semaphore}, these methods
 affect only internal counts; they do not establish any further
 internal bookkeeping. In particular, the identities of pending
 tasks are not maintained. As illustrated below, you can create
 subclasses that do record some or all pending tasks or their
 results when needed.  As illustrated below, utility methods
 supporting customization of completion traversals are also
 provided. However, because CountedCompleters provide only basic
 synchronization mechanisms, it may be useful to create further
 abstract subclasses that maintain linkages, fields, and additional
 support methods appropriate for a set of related usages.

 &lt;p&gt;A concrete CountedCompleter class must define method {@link #compute}, that should in most cases (as illustrated below), invoke
 {@code tryComplete()} once before returning. The class may also
 optionally override method {@link #onCompletion}(CountedCompleter)
 to perform an action upon normal completion, and method
 {@link #onExceptionalCompletion(Throwable, java.util.concurrent.CountedCompleter)} to
 perform an action upon any exception.

 &lt;p&gt;CountedCompleters most often do not bear results, in which case
 they are normally declared as {@code CountedCompleter&lt;Void&gt;}, and
 will always return {@code null} as a result value.  In other cases,
 you should override method {@link #getRawResult} to provide a
 result from {@code join(), invoke()}, and related methods.  In
 general, this method should return the value of a field (or a
 function of one or more fields) of the CountedCompleter object that
 holds the result upon completion. Method {@link #setRawResult} by
 default plays no role in CountedCompleters.  It is possible, but
 rarely applicable, to override this method to maintain other
 objects or fields holding result data.

 &lt;p&gt;A CountedCompleter that does not itself have a completer (i.e.,
 one for which {@link #getCompleter} returns {@code null}) can be
 used as a regular ForkJoinTask with this added functionality.
 However, any completer that in turn has another completer serves
 only as an internal helper for other computations, so its own task
 status (as reported in methods such as {@link java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask#isDone})
 is arbitrary; this status changes only upon explicit invocations of
 {@link #complete}, {@link java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask#cancel},
 {@link java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask#completeExceptionally(Throwable)} or upon
 exceptional completion of method {@code compute}. Upon any
 exceptional completion, the exception may be relayed to a task's
 completer (and its completer, and so on), if one exists and it has
 not otherwise already completed. Similarly, cancelling an internal
 CountedCompleter has only a local effect on that completer, so is
 not often useful.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample Usages.&lt;/b&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parallel recursive decomposition.&lt;/b&gt; CountedCompleters may
 be arranged in trees similar to those often used with {@link java.util.concurrent.RecursiveAction}s, although the constructions involved in setting
 them up typically vary. Here, the completer of each task is its
 parent in the computation tree. Even though they entail a bit more
 bookkeeping, CountedCompleters may be better choices when applying
 a possibly time-consuming operation (that cannot be further
 subdivided) to each element of an array or collection; especially
 when the operation takes a significantly different amount of time
 to complete for some elements than others, either because of
 intrinsic variation (for example I/O) or auxiliary effects such as
 garbage collection.  Because CountedCompleters provide their own
 continuations, other threads need not block waiting to perform
 them.

 &lt;p&gt;For example, here is an initial version of a class that uses
 divide-by-two recursive decomposition to divide work into single
 pieces (leaf tasks). Even when work is split into individual calls,
 tree-based techniques are usually preferable to directly forking
 leaf tasks, because they reduce inter-thread communication and
 improve load balancing. In the recursive case, the second of each
 pair of subtasks to finish triggers completion of its parent
 (because no result combination is performed, the default no-op
 implementation of method {@code onCompletion} is not overridden).
 A static utility method sets up the base task and invokes it
 (here, implicitly using the {@link java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool#commonPool()}).

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class MyOperation&lt;E&gt; { void apply(E e) { ... }  }

 class ForEach&lt;E&gt; extends CountedCompleter&lt;Void&gt; {

   public static &lt;E&gt; void forEach(E[] array, MyOperation&lt;E&gt; op) {
     new ForEach&lt;E&gt;(null, array, op, 0, array.length).invoke();
   }

   final E[] array; final MyOperation&lt;E&gt; op; final int lo, hi;
   ForEach(CountedCompleter&lt;?&gt; p, E[] array, MyOperation&lt;E&gt; op, int lo, int hi) {
     super(p);
     this.array = array; this.op = op; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
   }

   public void compute() { // version 1
     if (hi - lo &gt;= 2) {
       int mid = (lo + hi) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;
       setPendingCount(2); // must set pending count before fork
       new ForEach(this, array, op, mid, hi).fork(); // right child
       new ForEach(this, array, op, lo, mid).fork(); // left child
     }
     else if (hi &gt; lo)
       op.apply(array[lo]);
     tryComplete();
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 This design can be improved by noticing that in the recursive case,
 the task has nothing to do after forking its right task, so can
 directly invoke its left task before returning. (This is an analog
 of tail recursion removal.)  Also, because the task returns upon
 executing its left task (rather than falling through to invoke
 {@code tryComplete}) the pending count is set to one:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class ForEach&lt;E&gt; ... {
   ...
   public void compute() { // version 2
     if (hi - lo &gt;= 2) {
       int mid = (lo + hi) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;
       setPendingCount(1); // only one pending
       new ForEach(this, array, op, mid, hi).fork(); // right child
       new ForEach(this, array, op, lo, mid).compute(); // direct invoke
     }
     else {
       if (hi &gt; lo)
         op.apply(array[lo]);
       tryComplete();
     }
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 As a further optimization, notice that the left task need not even exist.
 Instead of creating a new one, we can iterate using the original task,
 and add a pending count for each fork.  Additionally, because no task
 in this tree implements an {@link #onCompletion}(CountedCompleter) method,
 {@code tryComplete()} can be replaced with {@link #propagateCompletion}.

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class ForEach&lt;E&gt; ... {
   ...
   public void compute() { // version 3
     int l = lo, h = hi;
     while (h - l &gt;= 2) {
       int mid = (l + h) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;
       addToPendingCount(1);
       new ForEach(this, array, op, mid, h).fork(); // right child
       h = mid;
     }
     if (h &gt; l)
       op.apply(array[l]);
     propagateCompletion();
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 Additional optimizations of such classes might entail precomputing
 pending counts so that they can be established in constructors,
 specializing classes for leaf steps, subdividing by say, four,
 instead of two per iteration, and using an adaptive threshold
 instead of always subdividing down to single elements.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Searching.&lt;/b&gt; A tree of CountedCompleters can search for a
 value or property in different parts of a data structure, and
 report a result in an {@link java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference AtomicReference} as
 soon as one is found. The others can poll the result to avoid
 unnecessary work. (You could additionally {@linkplain #cancel
 cancel} other tasks, but it is usually simpler and more efficient
 to just let them notice that the result is set and if so skip
 further processing.)  Illustrating again with an array using full
 partitioning (again, in practice, leaf tasks will almost always
 process more than one element):

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class Searcher&lt;E&gt; extends CountedCompleter&lt;E&gt; {
   final E[] array; final AtomicReference&lt;E&gt; result; final int lo, hi;
   Searcher(CountedCompleter&lt;?&gt; p, E[] array, AtomicReference&lt;E&gt; result, int lo, int hi) {
     super(p);
     this.array = array; this.result = result; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
   }
   public E getRawResult() { return result.get(); }
   public void compute() { // similar to ForEach version 3
     int l = lo, h = hi;
     while (result.get() == null &amp;&amp; h &gt;= l) {
       if (h - l &gt;= 2) {
         int mid = (l + h) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;
         addToPendingCount(1);
         new Searcher(this, array, result, mid, h).fork();
         h = mid;
       }
       else {
         E x = array[l];
         if (matches(x) &amp;&amp; result.compareAndSet(null, x))
           quietlyCompleteRoot(); // root task is now joinable
         break;
       }
     }
     tryComplete(); // normally complete whether or not found
   }
   boolean matches(E e) { ... } // return true if found

   public static &lt;E&gt; E search(E[] array) {
       return new Searcher&lt;E&gt;(null, array, new AtomicReference&lt;E&gt;(), 0, array.length).invoke();
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 In this example, as well as others in which tasks have no other
 effects except to {@code compareAndSet} a common result, the
 trailing unconditional invocation of {@code tryComplete} could be
 made conditional ({@code if (result.get() == null) tryComplete();})
 because no further bookkeeping is required to manage completions
 once the root task completes.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recording subtasks.&lt;/b&gt; CountedCompleter tasks that combine
 results of multiple subtasks usually need to access these results
 in method {@link #onCompletion}(CountedCompleter). As illustrated in the following
 class (that performs a simplified form of map-reduce where mappings
 and reductions are all of type {@code E}), one way to do this in
 divide and conquer designs is to have each subtask record its
 sibling, so that it can be accessed in method {@code onCompletion}.
 This technique applies to reductions in which the order of
 combining left and right results does not matter; ordered
 reductions require explicit left/right designations.  Variants of
 other streamlinings seen in the above examples may also apply.

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class MyMapper&lt;E&gt; { E apply(E v) {  ...  } }
 class MyReducer&lt;E&gt; { E apply(E x, E y) {  ...  } }
 class MapReducer&lt;E&gt; extends CountedCompleter&lt;E&gt; {
   final E[] array; final MyMapper&lt;E&gt; mapper;
   final MyReducer&lt;E&gt; reducer; final int lo, hi;
   MapReducer&lt;E&gt; sibling;
   E result;
   MapReducer(CountedCompleter&lt;?&gt; p, E[] array, MyMapper&lt;E&gt; mapper,
              MyReducer&lt;E&gt; reducer, int lo, int hi) {
     super(p);
     this.array = array; this.mapper = mapper;
     this.reducer = reducer; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
   }
   public void compute() {
     if (hi - lo &gt;= 2) {
       int mid = (lo + hi) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;
       MapReducer&lt;E&gt; left = new MapReducer(this, array, mapper, reducer, lo, mid);
       MapReducer&lt;E&gt; right = new MapReducer(this, array, mapper, reducer, mid, hi);
       left.sibling = right;
       right.sibling = left;
       setPendingCount(1); // only right is pending
       right.fork();
       left.compute();     // directly execute left
     }
     else {
       if (hi &gt; lo)
           result = mapper.apply(array[lo]);
       tryComplete();
     }
   }
   public void onCompletion(CountedCompleter&lt;?&gt; caller) {
     if (caller != this) {
       MapReducer&lt;E&gt; child = (MapReducer&lt;E&gt;)caller;
       MapReducer&lt;E&gt; sib = child.sibling;
       if (sib == null || sib.result == null)
         result = child.result;
       else
         result = reducer.apply(child.result, sib.result);
     }
   }
   public E getRawResult() { return result; }

   public static &lt;E&gt; E mapReduce(E[] array, MyMapper&lt;E&gt; mapper, MyReducer&lt;E&gt; reducer) {
     return new MapReducer&lt;E&gt;(null, array, mapper, reducer,
                              0, array.length).invoke();
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 Here, method {@code onCompletion} takes a form common to many
 completion designs that combine results. This callback-style method
 is triggered once per task, in either of the two different contexts
 in which the pending count is, or becomes, zero: (1) by a task
 itself, if its pending count is zero upon invocation of {@code
 tryComplete}, or (2) by any of its subtasks when they complete and
 decrement the pending count to zero. The {@code caller} argument
 distinguishes cases.  Most often, when the caller is {@code this},
 no action is necessary. Otherwise the caller argument can be used
 (usually via a cast) to supply a value (and/or links to other
 values) to be combined.  Assuming proper use of pending counts, the
 actions inside {@code onCompletion} occur (once) upon completion of
 a task and its subtasks. No additional synchronization is required
 within this method to ensure thread safety of accesses to fields of
 this task or other completed tasks.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Completion Traversals&lt;/b&gt;. If using {@code onCompletion} to
 process completions is inapplicable or inconvenient, you can use
 methods {@link #firstComplete} and {@link #nextComplete} to create
 custom traversals.  For example, to define a MapReducer that only
 splits out right-hand tasks in the form of the third ForEach
 example, the completions must cooperatively reduce along
 unexhausted subtask links, which can be done as follows:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class MapReducer&lt;E&gt; extends CountedCompleter&lt;E&gt; { // version 2
   final E[] array; final MyMapper&lt;E&gt; mapper;
   final MyReducer&lt;E&gt; reducer; final int lo, hi;
   MapReducer&lt;E&gt; forks, next; // record subtask forks in list
   E result;
   MapReducer(CountedCompleter&lt;?&gt; p, E[] array, MyMapper&lt;E&gt; mapper,
              MyReducer&lt;E&gt; reducer, int lo, int hi, MapReducer&lt;E&gt; next) {
     super(p);
     this.array = array; this.mapper = mapper;
     this.reducer = reducer; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
     this.next = next;
   }
   public void compute() {
     int l = lo, h = hi;
     while (h - l &gt;= 2) {
       int mid = (l + h) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;
       addToPendingCount(1);
       (forks = new MapReducer(this, array, mapper, reducer, mid, h, forks)).fork();
       h = mid;
     }
     if (h &gt; l)
       result = mapper.apply(array[l]);
     // process completions by reducing along and advancing subtask links
     for (CountedCompleter&lt;?&gt; c = firstComplete(); c != null; c = c.nextComplete()) {
       for (MapReducer t = (MapReducer)c, s = t.forks; s != null; s = t.forks = s.next)
         t.result = reducer.apply(t.result, s.result);
     }
   }
   public E getRawResult() { return result; }

   public static &lt;E&gt; E mapReduce(E[] array, MyMapper&lt;E&gt; mapper, MyReducer&lt;E&gt; reducer) {
     return new MapReducer&lt;E&gt;(null, array, mapper, reducer,
                              0, array.length, null).invoke();
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Triggers.&lt;/b&gt; Some CountedCompleters are themselves never
 forked, but instead serve as bits of plumbing in other designs;
 including those in which the completion of one or more async tasks
 triggers another async task. For example:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class HeaderBuilder extends CountedCompleter&lt;...&gt; { ... }
 class BodyBuilder extends CountedCompleter&lt;...&gt; { ... }
 class PacketSender extends CountedCompleter&lt;...&gt; {
   PacketSender(...) { super(null, 1); ... } // trigger on second completion
   public void compute() { } // never called
   public void onCompletion(CountedCompleter&lt;?&gt; caller) { sendPacket(); }
 }
 // sample use:
 PacketSender p = new PacketSender();
 new HeaderBuilder(p, ...).fork();
 new BodyBuilder(p, ...).fork();}&lt;/pre&gt;
