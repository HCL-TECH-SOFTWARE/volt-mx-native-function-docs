</span> implements java.security.Principal

 This interface is used to represent a group of principals. (A principal
 represents an entity such as an individual user or a company). &lt;p&gt;

 Note that Group extends Principal. Thus, either a Principal or a Group can
 be passed as an argument to methods containing a Principal parameter. For
 example, you can add either a Principal or a Group to a Group object by
 calling the object's {@code addMember} method, passing it the
 Principal or Group.
