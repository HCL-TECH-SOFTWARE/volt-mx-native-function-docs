</span>@extends java.lang.RuntimeException

 Thrown by a method invocation on a proxy instance if its invocation
 handler's {@link java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler#invoke invoke} method throws a
 checked exception (a {@code Throwable} that is not assignable
 to {@code RuntimeException} or {@code Error}) that
 is not assignable to any of the exception types declared in the
 {@code throws} clause of the method that was invoked on the
 proxy instance and dispatched to the invocation handler.

 &lt;p&gt;An {@code UndeclaredThrowableException} instance contains
 the undeclared checked exception that was thrown by the invocation
 handler, and it can be retrieved with the
 {@code getUndeclaredThrowable()} method.
 {@code UndeclaredThrowableException} extends
 {@code RuntimeException}, so it is an unchecked exception
 that wraps a checked exception.

 &lt;p&gt;As of release 1.4, this exception has been retrofitted to
 conform to the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism.  The
 &quot;undeclared checked exception that was thrown by the invocation
 handler&quot; that may be provided at construction time and accessed via
 the {@link #getUndeclaredThrowable}() method is now known as the
 &lt;i&gt;cause&lt;/i&gt;, and may be accessed via the {@link Throwable#getCause()} method, as well as the aforementioned &quot;legacy
 method.&quot;
