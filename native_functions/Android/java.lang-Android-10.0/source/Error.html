 An {@code Error} is a subclass of {@code Throwable}
 that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application
 should not try to catch. Most such errors are abnormal conditions.
 The {@code ThreadDeath} error, though a &quot;normal&quot; condition,
 is also a subclass of {@code Error} because most applications
 should not try to catch it.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A method is not required to declare in its {@code throws}
 clause any subclasses of {@code Error} that might be thrown
 during the execution of the method but not caught, since these
 errors are abnormal conditions that should never occur.

 That is, {@code Error} and its subclasses are regarded as unchecked
 exceptions for the purposes of compile-time checking of exceptions.
