</span> implements java.io.Serializable

@extends java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractOwnableSynchronizer

 A version of {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer} in
 which synchronization state is maintained as a {@code long}.
 This class has exactly the same structure, properties, and methods
 as {@code AbstractQueuedSynchronizer} with the exception
 that all state-related parameters and results are defined
 as {@code long} rather than {@code int}. This class
 may be useful when creating synchronizers such as
 multilevel locks and barriers that require
 64 bits of state.

 &lt;p&gt;See {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer} for usage
 notes and examples.

 @since 1.6

 &lt;p&gt;Note that because cancellations due to interrupts and
 timeouts may occur at any time, a {@code true} return does not
 guarantee that some other thread will acquire before the current
 thread.  Likewise, it is possible for another thread to win a
 race to enqueue after this method has returned {@code false},
 due to the queue being empty.

 avoid &lt;a href=&quot;AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.html#barging&quot;&gt;barging&lt;/a&gt;.
 Such a synchronizer's {@link #tryAcquire} method should return
 {@code false}, and its {@link #tryAcquireShared} method should
 return a negative value, if this method returns {@code true}
 (unless this is a reentrant acquire).  For example, the {@code
 tryAcquire} method for a fair, reentrant, exclusive mode
 synchronizer might look like this:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 protected boolean tryAcquire(int arg) {
