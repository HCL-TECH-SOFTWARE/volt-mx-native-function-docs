</span> implements java.io.Serializable

@extends java.util.concurrent.atomic.Striped64

 One or more variables that together maintain a running {@code long}
 value updated using a supplied function.  When updates (method
 {@link #accumulate}) are contended across threads, the set of variables
 may grow dynamically to reduce contention.  Method {@link #get}
 (or, equivalently, {@link #longValue}) returns the current value
 across the variables maintaining updates.

 &lt;p&gt;This class is usually preferable to {@link java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong} when
 multiple threads update a common value that is used for purposes such
 as collecting statistics, not for fine-grained synchronization
 control.  Under low update contention, the two classes have similar
 characteristics. But under high contention, expected throughput of
 this class is significantly higher, at the expense of higher space
 consumption.

 &lt;p&gt;The order of accumulation within or across threads is not
 guaranteed and cannot be depended upon, so this class is only
 applicable to functions for which the order of accumulation does
 not matter. The supplied accumulator function should be
 side-effect-free, since it may be re-applied when attempted updates
 fail due to contention among threads. The function is applied with
 the current value as its first argument, and the given update as
 the second argument.  For example, to maintain a running maximum
 value, you could supply {@code Long::max} along with {@code
 Long.MIN_VALUE} as the identity.

 &lt;p&gt;Class {@link java.util.concurrent.atomic.LongAdder} provides analogs of the functionality of
 this class for the common special case of maintaining counts and
 sums.  The call {@code new LongAdder()} is equivalent to {@code new
 LongAccumulator((x, y) -&gt; x + y, 0L}.

 &lt;p&gt;This class extends {@link Number}, but does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; define
 methods such as {@code equals}, {@code hashCode} and {@code
 compareTo} because instances are expected to be mutated, and so are
 not useful as collection keys.
