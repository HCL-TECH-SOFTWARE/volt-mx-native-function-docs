 A mutable builder for a {@code DoubleStream}.

 &lt;p&gt;A stream builder has a lifecycle, which starts in a building
 phase, during which elements can be added, and then transitions to a built
 phase, after which elements may not be added.  The built phase
 begins when the {@link #build}() method is called, which creates an
 ordered stream whose elements are the elements that were added to the
 stream builder, in the order they were added.
