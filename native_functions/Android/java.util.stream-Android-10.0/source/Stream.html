</span> implements java.util.stream.BaseStream

 A sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate
 operations.  The following example illustrates an aggregate operation using
 {@link java.util.stream.Stream} and {@link java.util.stream.IntStream}:

 &lt;pre&gt;{@code
     int sum = widgets.stream()
                      .filter(w -&gt; w.getColor() == RED)
                      .mapToInt(w -&gt; w.getWeight())
                      .sum();
 }&lt;/pre&gt;

 In this example, {@code widgets} is a {@code Collection&lt;Widget&gt;}.  We create
 a stream of {@code Widget} objects via {@link Collection#stream Collection.stream()},
 filter it to produce a stream containing only the red widgets, and then
 transform it into a stream of {@code int} values representing the weight of
 each red widget. Then this stream is summed to produce a total weight.

 &lt;p&gt;In addition to {@code Stream}, which is a stream of object references,
 there are primitive specializations for {@link java.util.stream.IntStream}, {@link java.util.stream.LongStream},
 and {@link java.util.stream.DoubleStream}, all of which are referred to as &quot;streams&quot; and
 conform to the characteristics and restrictions described here.

 &lt;p&gt;To perform a computation, stream
 &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#StreamOps&quot;&gt;operations&lt;/a&gt; are composed into a
 &lt;em&gt;stream pipeline&lt;/em&gt;.  A stream pipeline consists of a source (which
 might be an array, a collection, a generator function, an I/O channel,
 etc), zero or more &lt;em&gt;intermediate operations&lt;/em&gt; (which transform a
 stream into another stream, such as {@link java.util.stream.Stream#filter(Predicate)}), and a
 &lt;em&gt;terminal operation&lt;/em&gt; (which produces a result or side-effect, such
 as {@link java.util.stream.Stream#count()} or {@link java.util.stream.Stream#forEach(Consumer)}).
 Streams are lazy; computation on the source data is only performed when the
 terminal operation is initiated, and source elements are consumed only
 as needed.

 &lt;p&gt;Collections and streams, while bearing some superficial similarities,
 have different goals.  Collections are primarily concerned with the efficient
 management of, and access to, their elements.  By contrast, streams do not
 provide a means to directly access or manipulate their elements, and are
 instead concerned with declaratively describing their source and the
 computational operations which will be performed in aggregate on that source.
 However, if the provided stream operations do not offer the desired
 functionality, the {@link #iterator}() and {@link #spliterator}() operations
 can be used to perform a controlled traversal.

 &lt;p&gt;A stream pipeline, like the &quot;widgets&quot; example above, can be viewed as
 a &lt;em&gt;query&lt;/em&gt; on the stream source.  Unless the source was explicitly
 designed for concurrent modification (such as a {@link ConcurrentHashMap}),
 unpredictable or erroneous behavior may result from modifying the stream
 source while it is being queried.

 &lt;p&gt;Most stream operations accept parameters that describe user-specified
 behavior, such as the lambda expression {@code w -&gt; w.getWeight()} passed to
 {@code mapToInt} in the example above.  To preserve correct behavior,
 these &lt;em&gt;behavioral parameters&lt;/em&gt;:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;must be &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#NonInterference&quot;&gt;non-interfering&lt;/a&gt;
 (they do not modify the stream source); and&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;in most cases must be &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#Statelessness&quot;&gt;stateless&lt;/a&gt;
 (their result should not depend on any state that might change during execution
 of the stream pipeline).&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Such parameters are always instances of a
 &lt;a href=&quot;../function/package-summary.html&quot;&gt;functional interface&lt;/a&gt; such
 as {@link java.util.function.Function}, and are often lambda expressions or
 method references.  Unless otherwise specified these parameters must be
 &lt;em&gt;non-null&lt;/em&gt;.

 &lt;p&gt;A stream should be operated on (invoking an intermediate or terminal stream
 operation) only once.  This rules out, for example, &quot;forked&quot; streams, where
 the same source feeds two or more pipelines, or multiple traversals of the
 same stream.  A stream implementation may throw {@link IllegalStateException}
 if it detects that the stream is being reused. However, since some stream
 operations may return their receiver rather than a new stream object, it may
 not be possible to detect reuse in all cases.

 &lt;p&gt;Streams have a {@link #close}() method and implement {@link AutoCloseable},
 but nearly all stream instances do not actually need to be closed after use.
 Generally, only streams whose source is an IO channel (such as those returned
 by {@link Files#lines(Path, Charset)}) will require closing.  Most streams
 are backed by collections, arrays, or generating functions, which require no
 special resource management.  (If a stream does require closing, it can be
 declared as a resource in a {@code try}-with-resources statement.)

 &lt;p&gt;Stream pipelines may execute either sequentially or in
 &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#Parallelism&quot;&gt;parallel&lt;/a&gt;.  This
 execution mode is a property of the stream.  Streams are created
 with an initial choice of sequential or parallel execution.  (For example,
 {@link Collection#stream() Collection.stream()} creates a sequential stream,
 and {@link Collection#parallelStream() Collection.parallelStream()} creates
 a parallel one.)  This choice of execution mode may be modified by the
 {@link #sequential}() or {@link #parallel}() methods, and may be queried with
 the {@link #isParallel}() method.
