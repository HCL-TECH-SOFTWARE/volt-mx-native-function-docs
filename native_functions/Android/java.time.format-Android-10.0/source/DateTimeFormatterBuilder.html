 Builder to create date-time formatters.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This allows a {@code DateTimeFormatter} to be created.
 All date-time formatters are created ultimately using this builder.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The basic elements of date-time can all be added:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Value - a numeric value&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Fraction - a fractional value including the decimal place. Always use this when
 outputting fractions to ensure that the fraction is parsed correctly&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Text - the textual equivalent for the value&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;OffsetId/Offset - the {@linkplain ZoneOffset zone offset}&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;ZoneId - the {@linkplain ZoneId time-zone} id&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;ZoneText - the name of the time-zone&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;ChronologyId - the {@linkplain Chronology chronology} id&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;ChronologyText - the name of the chronology&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Literal - a text literal&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Nested and Optional - formats can be nested or made optional&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 In addition, any of the elements may be decorated by padding, either with spaces or any other character.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Finally, a shorthand pattern, mostly compatible with {@code java.text.SimpleDateFormat SimpleDateFormat}
 can be used, see {@link #appendPattern}(String).
 In practice, this simply parses the pattern and calls other methods on the builder.

 @implSpec
 This class is a mutable builder intended for use from a single thread.

</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This appends an instruction to the builder to inject a default value
 into the parsed result. This is especially useful in conjunction with
 optional parts of the formatter.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For example, consider a formatter that parses the year, followed by
 an optional month, with a further optional day-of-month. Using such a
 formatter would require the calling code to check whether a full date,
 year-month or just a year had been parsed. This method can be used to
 default the month and day-of-month to a sensible value, such as the
 first of the month, allowing the calling code to always get a date.
 &lt;p&gt;
 During formatting, this method has no effect.
 &lt;p&gt;
 During parsing, the current state of the parse is inspected.
 If the specified field has no associated value, because it has not been
 parsed successfully at that point, then the specified value is injected
 into the parse result. Injection is immediate, thus the field-value pair
 will be visible to any subsequent elements in the formatter.
 As such, this method is normally called at the end of the builder.

 The value will be printed as per the normal format of an integer value.
 Only negative numbers will be signed. No padding will be added.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The parser for a variable width value such as this normally behaves greedily,
 requiring one digit, but accepting as many digits as possible.
 This behavior can be affected by 'adjacent value parsing'.
 See {@link #appendValue(java.time.temporal.TemporalField, int)} for full details.

</span> width, zero-padded approach.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The value of the field will be output during a format.
 If the value cannot be obtained then an exception will be thrown.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The value will be zero-padded on the left. If the size of the value
 means that it cannot be printed within the width then an exception is thrown.
 If the value of the field is negative then an exception is thrown during formatting.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This method supports a special technique of parsing known as 'adjacent value parsing'.
 This technique solves the problem where a value, variable or fixed width, is followed by one or more
 fixed length values. The standard parser is greedy, and thus it would normally
 steal the digits that are needed by the fixed width value parsers that follow the
 variable width one.
 &lt;p&gt;
 No action is required to initiate 'adjacent value parsing'.
 When a call to {@code appendValue} is made, the builder
 enters adjacent value parsing setup mode. If the immediately subsequent method
 call or calls on the same builder are for a fixed width value, then the parser will reserve
 space so that the fixed width values can be parsed.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For example, consider {@code builder.appendValue(YEAR).appendValue(MONTH_OF_YEAR, 2);}
 The year is a variable width parse of between 1 and 19 digits.
 The month is a fixed width parse of 2 digits.
 Because these were appended to the same builder immediately after one another,
 the year parser will reserve two digits for the month to parse.
 Thus, the text '201106' will correctly parse to a year of 2011 and a month of 6.
 Without adjacent value parsing, the year would greedily parse all six digits and leave
 nothing for the month.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Adjacent value parsing applies to each set of fixed width not-negative values in the parser
 that immediately follow any kind of value, variable or fixed width.
 Calling any other append method will end the setup of adjacent value parsing.
 Thus, in the unlikely event that you need to avoid adjacent value parsing behavior,
 simply add the {@code appendValue} to another {@code DateTimeFormatterBuilder}
 and add that to this builder.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If adjacent parsing is active, then parsing must match exactly the specified
 number of digits in both strict and lenient modes.
 In addition, no positive or negative sign is permitted.

 This method provides full control of the numeric formatting, including
 zero-padding and the positive/negative sign.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The parser for a variable width value such as this normally behaves greedily,
 accepting as many digits as possible.
 This behavior can be affected by 'adjacent value parsing'.
 See {@link #appendValue(java.time.temporal.TemporalField, int)} for full details.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In strict parsing mode, the minimum number of parsed digits is {@code minWidth}
 and the maximum is {@code maxWidth}.
 In lenient parsing mode, the minimum number of parsed digits is one
 and the maximum is 19 (except as limited by adjacent value parsing).

<span id='java-time-format-DateTimeFormatterBuilder-method-appendValueReduced'>/**Appends the reduced value of a date-time field to the formatter.
</span> &lt;p&gt;
 Since fields such as year vary by chronology, it is recommended to use the
 {@link #appendValueReduced(TemporalField, int, int, ChronoLocalDate)} date}
 variant of this method in most cases. This variant is suitable for
 simple fields or working with only the ISO chronology.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For formatting, the {@code width} and {@code maxWidth} are used to
 determine the number of characters to format.
 If they are equal then the format is fixed width.
 If the value of the field is within the range of the {@code baseValue} using
 {@code width} characters then the reduced value is formatted otherwise the value is
 truncated to fit {@code maxWidth}.
 The rightmost characters are output to match the width, left padding with zero.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For strict parsing, the number of characters allowed by {@code width} to {@code maxWidth} are parsed.
 For lenient parsing, the number of characters must be at least 1 and less than 10.
 If the number of digits parsed is equal to {@code width} and the value is positive,
 the value of the field is computed to be the first number greater than
 or equal to the {@code baseValue} with the same least significant characters,
 otherwise the value parsed is the field value.
 This allows a reduced value to be entered for values in range of the baseValue
 and width and absolute values can be entered for values outside the range.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For example, a base value of {@code 1980} and a width of {@code 2} will have
 valid values from {@code 1980} to {@code 2079}.
 During parsing, the text {@code &quot;12&quot;} will result in the value {@code 2012} as that
 is the value within the range where the last two characters are &quot;12&quot;.
 By contrast, parsing the text {@code &quot;1915&quot;} will result in the value {@code 1915}.

 This is typically used for formatting and parsing a two digit year.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The base date is used to calculate the full value during parsing.
 For example, if the base date is 1950-01-01 then parsed values for
 a two digit year parse will be in the range 1950-01-01 to 2049-12-31.
 Only the year would be extracted from the date, thus a base date of
 1950-08-25 would also parse to the range 1950-01-01 to 2049-12-31.
 This behavior is necessary to support fields such as week-based-year
 or other calendar systems where the parsed value does not align with
 standard ISO years.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The exact behavior is as follows. Parse the full set of fields and
 determine the effective chronology using the last chronology if
 it appears more than once. Then convert the base date to the
 effective chronology. Then extract the specified field from the
 chronology-specific base date and use it to determine the
 {@code baseValue} used below.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For formatting, the {@code width} and {@code maxWidth} are used to
 determine the number of characters to format.
 If they are equal then the format is fixed width.
 If the value of the field is within the range of the {@code baseValue} using
 {@code width} characters then the reduced value is formatted otherwise the value is
 truncated to fit {@code maxWidth}.
 The rightmost characters are output to match the width, left padding with zero.

 The printed fraction will have the minimum width necessary between

 The supplied map is not validated by the builder to ensure that formatting or

 Supplying the map of text provides considerable flexibility in formatting and parsing.
 For example, a legacy application might require or supply the months of the
 year as &quot;JNY&quot;, &quot;FBY&quot;, &quot;MCH&quot; etc. These do not match the standard set of text
 for localized month names. Using this method, a map can be created which

 Any sequence of letters not specified above, unrecognized letter or
 reserved character will throw an exception.
 Future versions may add to the set of patterns.
 It is recommended to use single quotes around all characters that you want
 to output directly to ensure that future changes do not break your application.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Note that the pattern string is similar, but not identical, to
 {@link java.text.SimpleDateFormat SimpleDateFormat}.
 The pattern string is also similar, but not identical, to that defined by the
 Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR/LDML).
 Pattern letters 'X' and 'u' are aligned with Unicode CLDR/LDML.
 By contrast, {@code SimpleDateFormat} uses 'u' for the numeric day of week.
 Pattern letters 'y' and 'Y' parse years of two digits and more than 4 digits differently.
 Pattern letters 'n', 'A', 'N', and 'p' are added.
 Number types will reject large numbers.
