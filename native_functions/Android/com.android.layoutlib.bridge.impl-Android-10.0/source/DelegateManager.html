 Manages native delegates.

 This is used in conjunction with layoublib_create: certain Android java classes are mere
 wrappers around a heavily native based implementation, and we need a way to run these classes
 in our Android Studio rendering framework without bringing all the native code from the Android
 platform.

 Thus we instruct layoutlib_create to modify the bytecode of these classes to replace their
 native methods by &quot;delegate calls&quot;.

 For example, a native method android.graphics.Matrix.init(...) will actually become
 a call to android.graphics.Matrix_Delegate.init(...).

 The Android java classes that use native code uses an int (Java side) to reference native
 objects. This int is generally directly the pointer to the C structure counterpart.
 Typically a creation method will return such an int, and then this int will be passed later
 to a Java method to identify the C object to manipulate.

 Since we cannot use the Java object reference as the int directly, DelegateManager manages the
 int -&gt; Delegate class link.

 Native methods usually always have the int as parameters. The first thing the delegate method
 will do is call {@link #getDelegate}(long) to get the Java object matching the int.

 Typical native init methods are returning a new int back to the Java class, so
 {@link #addNewDelegate}(Object) does the same.

 The JNI references are counted, so we do the same through a {@link WeakReference}. Because
 the Java object needs to count as a reference (even though it only holds an int), we use the
 following mechanism:

 - {@link #addNewDelegate}(Object) and {@link #removeJavaReferenceFor}(long) adds and removes
   the delegate to/from a set. This set holds the reference and prevents the GC from reclaiming
   the delegate.

 - {@link #addNewDelegate}(Object) also adds the delegate to a {@link SparseArray} that holds a
   {@link WeakReference} to the delegate. This allows the delegate to be deleted automatically
   when nothing references it. This means that any class that holds a delegate (except for the
   Java main class) must not use the int but the Delegate class instead. The integers must
   only be used in the API between the main Java class and the Delegate.
