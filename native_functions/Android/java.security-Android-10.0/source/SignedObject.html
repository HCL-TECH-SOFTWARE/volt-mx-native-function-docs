@extends java.lang.Object

 &lt;p&gt; SignedObject is a class for the purpose of creating authentic
 runtime objects whose integrity cannot be compromised without being
 detected.

 &lt;p&gt; More specifically, a SignedObject contains another Serializable
 object, the (to-be-)signed object and its signature.

 &lt;p&gt; The signed object is a &quot;deep copy&quot; (in serialized form) of an
 original object.  Once the copy is made, further manipulation of
 the original object has no side effect on the copy.

 &lt;p&gt; The underlying signing algorithm is designated by the Signature
 object passed to the constructor and the {@code verify} method.
 A typical usage for signing is the following:

 &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 Signature signingEngine = Signature.getInstance(algorithm,
                                                 provider);
 SignedObject so = new SignedObject(myobject, signingKey,
                                    signingEngine);
 }&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; A typical usage for verification is the following (having
 received SignedObject {@code so}):

 &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 Signature verificationEngine =
     Signature.getInstance(algorithm, provider);
 if (so.verify(publickey, verificationEngine))
     try {
         Object myobj = so.getObject();
     } catch (java.lang.ClassNotFoundException e) {};
 }&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; Several points are worth noting.  First, there is no need to
 initialize the signing or verification engine, as it will be
 re-initialized inside the constructor and the {@code verify}
 method. Secondly, for verification to succeed, the specified
 public key must be the public key corresponding to the private key
 used to generate the SignedObject.

 &lt;p&gt; More importantly, for flexibility reasons, the
 constructor and {@code verify} method allow for
 customized signature engines, which can implement signature
 algorithms that are not installed formally as part of a crypto
 provider.  However, it is crucial that the programmer writing the
 verifier code be aware what {@code Signature} engine is being
 used, as its own implementation of the {@code verify} method
 is invoked to verify a signature.  In other words, a malicious
 {@code Signature} may choose to always return true on
 verification in an attempt to bypass a security check.

 &lt;p&gt; The signature algorithm can be, among others, the NIST standard
 DSA, using DSA and SHA-1.  The algorithm is specified using the
 same convention as that for signatures. The DSA algorithm using the
 SHA-1 message digest algorithm can be specified, for example, as
 &quot;SHA/DSA&quot; or &quot;SHA-1/DSA&quot; (they are equivalent).  In the case of
 RSA, there are multiple choices for the message digest algorithm,
 so the signing algorithm could be specified as, for example,
 &quot;MD2/RSA&quot;, &quot;MD5/RSA&quot; or &quot;SHA-1/RSA&quot;.  The algorithm name must be
 specified, as there is no default.

 &lt;p&gt; The name of the Cryptography Package Provider is designated
 also by the Signature parameter to the constructor and the
 {@code verify} method.  If the provider is not
 specified, the default provider is used.  Each installation can
 be configured to use a particular provider as default.

 &lt;p&gt; Potential applications of SignedObject include:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; It can be used
 internally to any Java runtime as an unforgeable authorization
 token -- one that can be passed around without the fear that the
 token can be maliciously modified without being detected.
 &lt;li&gt; It
 can be used to sign and serialize data/object for storage outside
 the Java runtime (e.g., storing critical access control data on
 disk).
 &lt;li&gt; Nested SignedObjects can be used to construct a logical
 sequence of signatures, resembling a chain of authorization and
 delegation.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
