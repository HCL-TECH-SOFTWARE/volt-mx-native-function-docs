</span>@extends java.security.Identity

 &lt;p&gt;This class represents a scope for identities. It is an Identity
 itself, and therefore has a name and can have a scope. It can also
 optionally have a public key and associated certificates.

 &lt;p&gt;An IdentityScope can contain Identity objects of all kinds, including
 Signers. All types of Identity objects can be retrieved, added, and
 removed using the same methods. Note that it is possible, and in fact
 expected, that different types of identity scopes will
 apply different policies for their various operations on the
 various types of Identities.

 &lt;p&gt;There is a one-to-one mapping between keys and identities, and
 there can only be one copy of one key per scope. For example, suppose
 &lt;b&gt;Acme Software, Inc&lt;/b&gt; is a software publisher known to a user.
 Suppose it is an Identity, that is, it has a public key, and a set of
 associated certificates. It is named in the scope using the name
 &quot;Acme Software&quot;. No other named Identity in the scope has the same
 public  key. Of course, none has the same name as well.
