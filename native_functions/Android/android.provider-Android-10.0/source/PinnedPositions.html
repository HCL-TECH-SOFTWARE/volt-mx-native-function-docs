 &lt;p&gt;
 Contact-specific information about whether or not a contact has been pinned by the user
 at a particular position within the system contact application's user interface.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 This pinning information can be used by individual applications to customize how
 they order particular pinned contacts. For example, a Dialer application could
 use pinned information to order user-pinned contacts in a top row of favorites.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 It is possible for two or more contacts to occupy the same pinned position (due
 to aggregation and sync), so this pinning information should be used on a best-effort
 basis to order contacts in-application rather than an absolute guide on where a contact
 should be positioned. Contacts returned by the ContactsProvider will not be ordered based
 on this information, so it is up to the client application to reorder these contacts within
 their own UI adhering to (or ignoring as appropriate) information stored in the pinned
 column.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 By default, unpinned contacts will have a pinned position of
 {@link android.provider.ContactsContract.PinnedPositions#UNPINNED}. Client-provided pinned positions can be positive
 integers that are greater than 1.
 &lt;/p&gt;
