</span> Interface for associating a SAX event with a document location.

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;em&gt;This module, both source code and documentation, is in the
 Public Domain, and comes with &lt;strong&gt;NO WARRANTY&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
 See &lt;a href='http://www.saxproject.org'&gt;http://www.saxproject.org&lt;/a&gt;
 for further information.
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If a SAX parser provides location information to the SAX
 application, it does so by implementing this interface and then
 passing an instance to the application using the content
 handler's {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#setDocumentLocator
 setDocumentLocator} method.  The application can use the
 object to obtain the location of any other SAX event
 in the XML source document.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Note that the results returned by the object will be valid only
 during the scope of each callback method: the application
 will receive unpredictable results if it attempts to use the
 locator at any other time, or after parsing completes.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;SAX parsers are not required to supply a locator, but they are
 very strongly encouraged to do so.  If the parser supplies a
 locator, it must do so before reporting any other document events.
 If no locator has been set by the time the application receives
 the {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#startDocument startDocument}
 event, the application should assume that a locator is not
 available.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If the system identifier is a URL, the parser must resolve it
 fully before passing it to the application.  For example, a file
 name must always be provided as a &lt;em&gt;file:...&lt;/em&gt; URL, and other
 kinds of relative URI are also resolved against their bases.&lt;/p&gt;

 For example, when lines contain combining character sequences, wide

 not correspond to the column in a text editor's display. &lt;/p&gt;
