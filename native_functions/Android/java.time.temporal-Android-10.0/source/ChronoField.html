</span> implements java.time.temporal.TemporalField

@extends java.lang.Enum

 A standard set of fields.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This set of fields provide field-based access to manipulate a date, time or date-time.
 The standard set of fields can be extended by implementing {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalField}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 These fields are intended to be applicable in multiple calendar systems.
 For example, most non-ISO calendar systems define dates as a year, month and day,
 just with slightly different rules.
 The documentation of each field explains how it operates.

 @implSpec
 This is a final, immutable and thread-safe enum.

 The era 'CE' is the one currently in use and year-of-era runs from 1 to the maximum value.
 The era 'BCE' is the previous era, and the year-of-era runs backwards.

 For example, subtracting a year each time yield the following:&lt;br&gt;

 Note that the ISO-8601 standard does not actually define eras.
 Note also that the ISO eras do not align with the well-known AD/BC eras due to the
 change between the Julian and Gregorian calendar systems.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Non-ISO calendar systems should implement this field using the most recognized
 year-of-era value for users of the calendar system.
 Since most calendar systems have only two eras, the year-of-era numbering approach

</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This represents the concept of the offset in seconds of local time from UTC/Greenwich.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A {@link ZoneOffset} represents the period of time that local time differs from UTC/Greenwich.
 This is usually a fixed number of hours and minutes.
 It is equivalent to the {@link ZoneOffset#getTotalSeconds() total amount} of the offset in seconds.
 For example, during the winter Paris has an offset of {@code +01:00}, which is 3600 seconds.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This field is strictly defined to have the same meaning in all calendar systems.
 This is necessary to ensure interoperation between calendars.
