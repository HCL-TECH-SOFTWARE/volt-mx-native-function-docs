</span> implements java.time.temporal.TemporalAccessor

 Framework-level interface defining read-write access to a temporal object,
 such as a date, time, offset or some combination of these.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This is the base interface type for date, time and offset objects that
 are complete enough to be manipulated using plus and minus.
 It is implemented by those classes that can provide and manipulate information
 as {@linkplain java.time.temporal.TemporalField fields} or {@linkplain java.time.temporal.TemporalQuery queries}.
 See {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalAccessor} for the read-only version of this interface.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Most date and time information can be represented as a number.
 These are modeled using {@code TemporalField} with the number held using
 a {@code long} to handle large values. Year, month and day-of-month are
 simple examples of fields, but they also include instant and offsets.
 See {@link java.time.temporal.ChronoField} for the standard set of fields.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Two pieces of date/time information cannot be represented by numbers,
 the {@linkplain java.time.chrono.Chronology chronology} and the
 {@linkplain java.time.ZoneId time-zone}.
 These can be accessed via {@link #query(TemporalQuery) queries} using
 the static methods defined on {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalQuery}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This interface is a framework-level interface that should not be widely
 used in application code. Instead, applications should create and pass
 around instances of concrete types, such as {@code LocalDate}.
 There are many reasons for this, part of which is that implementations
 of this interface may be in calendar systems other than ISO.
 See {@link java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate} for a fuller discussion of the issues.

 &lt;h3&gt;When to implement&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 A class should implement this interface if it meets three criteria:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;it provides access to date/time/offset information, as per {@code TemporalAccessor}
 &lt;li&gt;the set of fields are contiguous from the largest to the smallest
 &lt;li&gt;the set of fields are complete, such that no other field is needed to define the
  valid range of values for the fields that are represented
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 Four examples make this clear:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@code LocalDate} implements this interface as it represents a set of fields
  that are contiguous from days to forever and require no external information to determine
  the validity of each date. It is therefore able to implement plus/minus correctly.
 &lt;li&gt;{@code LocalTime} implements this interface as it represents a set of fields
  that are contiguous from nanos to within days and require no external information to determine
  validity. It is able to implement plus/minus correctly, by wrapping around the day.
 &lt;li&gt;{@code MonthDay}, the combination of month-of-year and day-of-month, does not implement
  this interface.  While the combination is contiguous, from days to months within years,
  the combination does not have sufficient information to define the valid range of values
  for day-of-month.  As such, it is unable to implement plus/minus correctly.
 &lt;li&gt;The combination day-of-week and day-of-month (&quot;Friday the 13th&quot;) should not implement
  this interface. It does not represent a contiguous set of fields, as days to weeks overlaps
  days to months.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 @implSpec
 This interface places no restrictions on the mutability of implementations,
 however immutability is strongly recommended.
 All implementations must be {@link Comparable}.

</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
 A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
 A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
 A selection of common adjustments is provided in
 {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters TemporalAdjusters}.
 These include finding the &quot;last day of the month&quot; and &quot;next Wednesday&quot;.
 The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
 lengths of month and leap years.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:
 &lt;pre&gt;
  date = date.with(Month.JULY);        // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
  date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth());  // static import from Adjusters
  date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY));   // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek

 For example, on a {@code LocalDate}, this could be used to set the year, month or day-of-month.
 The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.

 In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is

<span id='java-time-temporal-Temporal-method-until'>/**Calculates the amount of time until another temporal in terms of the specified unit.
</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This calculates the amount of time between two temporal objects
 in terms of a single {@code TemporalUnit}.
 The start and end points are {@code this} and the specified temporal.
 The end point is converted to be of the same type as the start point if different.
 The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
 For example, the amount in hours between two temporal objects can be
 calculated using {@code startTime.until(endTime, HOURS)}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
 complete units between the two temporals.
 For example, the amount in hours between the times 11:30 and 13:29
 will only be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.
 &lt;p&gt;
 There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
 The first is to invoke this method directly.
 The second is to use {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit#between(Temporal, Temporal)}:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   // these two lines are equivalent
   temporal = start.until(end, unit);
   temporal = unit.between(start, end);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For example, this method allows the number of days between two dates to
 be calculated:
 &lt;pre&gt;
  long daysBetween = start.until(end, DAYS);
  // or alternatively
  long daysBetween = DAYS.between(start, end);
 &lt;/pre&gt;

  same type as this object, not null

@param unit  the unit to measure the amount in, not null
@return {Number} the amount of time between this temporal object and the specified one
  in terms of the unit; positive if the specified object is later than this one,
  negative if it is earlier than this one
@throws DateTimeException if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
  temporal cannot be converted to the same type as this temporal
