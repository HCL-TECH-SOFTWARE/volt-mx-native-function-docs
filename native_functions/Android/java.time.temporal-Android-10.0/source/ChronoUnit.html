</span> implements java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit

@extends java.lang.Enum

 A standard set of date periods units.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This set of units provide unit-based access to manipulate a date, time or date-time.
 The standard set of units can be extended by implementing {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 These units are intended to be applicable in multiple calendar systems.
 For example, most non-ISO calendar systems define units of years, months and days,
 just with slightly different rules.
 The documentation of each unit explains how it operates.

 @implSpec
 This is a final, immutable and thread-safe enum.

 @since 1.8
