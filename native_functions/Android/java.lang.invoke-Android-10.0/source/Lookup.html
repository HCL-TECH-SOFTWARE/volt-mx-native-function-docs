</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 A &lt;em&gt;lookup object&lt;/em&gt; is a factory for creating method handles,
 when the creation requires access checking.
 Method handles do not perform
 access checks when they are called, but rather when they are created.
 Therefore, method handle access
 restrictions must be enforced when a method handle is created.
 The caller class against which those restrictions are enforced
 is known as the {@linkplain #lookupClass lookup class}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A lookup class which needs to create method handles will call
 {@link #lookup java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.lookup} to create a factory for itself.
 When the {@code Lookup} factory object is created, the identity of the lookup class is
 determined, and securely stored in the {@code Lookup} object.
 The lookup class (or its delegates) may then use factory methods
 on the {@code Lookup} object to create method handles for access-checked members.
 This includes all methods, constructors, and fields which are allowed to the lookup class,
 even private ones.

 &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;lookups&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Lookup Factory Methods&lt;/h1&gt;
 The factory methods on a {@code Lookup} object correspond to all major
 use cases for methods, constructors, and fields.
 Each method handle created by a factory method is the functional
 equivalent of a particular &lt;em&gt;bytecode behavior&lt;/em&gt;.
 (Bytecode behaviors are described in section 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)
 Here is a summary of the correspondence between these factory methods and
 the behavior the resulting method handles:

     &lt;th&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;equiv&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;lookup expression&lt;/th&gt;

 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;

 Here, the type {@code C} is the class or interface being searched for a member,
 documented as a parameter named {@code refc} in the lookup methods.
 The method type {@code MT} is composed from the return type {@code T}
 and the sequence of argument types {@code A*}.
 The constructor also has a sequence of argument types {@code A*} and
 is deemed to return the newly-created object of type {@code C}.
 Both {@code MT} and the field type {@code FT} are documented as a parameter named {@code type}.
 The formal parameter {@code this} stands for the self-reference of type {@code C};
 if it is present, it is always the leading argument to the method handle invocation.
 (In the case of some {@code protected} members, {@code this} may be
 restricted in type to the lookup class; see below.)
 The name {@code arg} stands for all the other method handle arguments.
 In the code examples for the Core Reflection API, the name {@code thisOrNull}
 stands for a null reference if the accessed method or field is static,
 and {@code this} otherwise.
 The names {@code aMethod}, {@code aField}, and {@code aConstructor} stand
 for reflective objects corresponding to the given members.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In cases where the given member is of variable arity (i.e., a method or constructor)
 the returned method handle will also be of {@linkplain java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle#asVarargsCollector variable arity}.
 In all other cases, the returned method handle will be of fixed arity.
 &lt;p style=&quot;font-size:smaller;&quot;&gt;
 &lt;em&gt;Discussion:&lt;/em&gt;
 The equivalence between looked-up method handles and underlying
 class members and bytecode behaviors
 can break down in a few ways:
 &lt;ul style=&quot;font-size:smaller;&quot;&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If {@code C} is not symbolically accessible from the lookup class's loader,
 the lookup can still succeed, even when there is no equivalent
 Java expression or bytecoded constant.
 &lt;li&gt;Likewise, if {@code T} or {@code MT}
 is not symbolically accessible from the lookup class's loader,
 the lookup can still succeed.
 For example, lookups for {@code MethodHandle.invokeExact} and
 {@code MethodHandle.invoke} will always succeed, regardless of requested type.
 &lt;li&gt;If there is a security manager installed, it can forbid the lookup
 on various grounds (&lt;a href=&quot;MethodHandles.Lookup.html#secmgr&quot;&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;).
 By contrast, the {@code ldc} instruction on a {@code CONSTANT_MethodHandle}
 constant is not subject to security manager checks.
 &lt;li&gt;If the looked-up method has a
 &lt;a href=&quot;MethodHandle.html#maxarity&quot;&gt;very large arity&lt;/a&gt;,
 the method handle creation may fail, due to the method handle
 type having too many parameters.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;access&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Access checking&lt;/h1&gt;
 Access checks are applied in the factory methods of {@code Lookup},
 when a method handle is created.
 This is a key difference from the Core Reflection API, since
 {@link java.lang.reflect.Method#invoke java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke}
 performs access checking against every caller, on every call.
 &lt;p&gt;
 All access checks start from a {@code Lookup} object, which
 compares its recorded lookup class against all requests to
 create method handles.
 A single {@code Lookup} object can be used to create any number
 of access-checked method handles, all checked against a single
 lookup class.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A {@code Lookup} object can be shared with other trusted code,
 such as a metaobject protocol.
 A shared {@code Lookup} object delegates the capability
 to create method handles on private members of the lookup class.
 Even if privileged code uses the {@code Lookup} object,
 the access checking is confined to the privileges of the
 original lookup class.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A lookup can fail, because
 the containing class is not accessible to the lookup class, or
 because the desired class member is missing, or because the
 desired class member is not accessible to the lookup class, or
 because the lookup object is not trusted enough to access the member.
 In any of these cases, a {@code ReflectiveOperationException} will be
 thrown from the attempted lookup.  The exact class will be one of
 the following:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;NoSuchMethodException &amp;mdash; if a method is requested but does not exist
 &lt;li&gt;NoSuchFieldException &amp;mdash; if a field is requested but does not exist
 &lt;li&gt;IllegalAccessException &amp;mdash; if the member exists but an access check fails
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 In general, the conditions under which a method handle may be
 looked up for a method {@code M} are no more restrictive than the conditions
 under which the lookup class could have compiled, verified, and resolved a call to {@code M}.
 Where the JVM would raise exceptions like {@code NoSuchMethodError},
 a method handle lookup will generally raise a corresponding
 checked exception, such as {@code NoSuchMethodException}.
 And the effect of invoking the method handle resulting from the lookup
 is &lt;a href=&quot;MethodHandles.Lookup.html#equiv&quot;&gt;exactly equivalent&lt;/a&gt;
 to executing the compiled, verified, and resolved call to {@code M}.
 The same point is true of fields and constructors.
 &lt;p style=&quot;font-size:smaller;&quot;&gt;
 &lt;em&gt;Discussion:&lt;/em&gt;
 Access checks only apply to named and reflected methods,
 constructors, and fields.
 Other method handle creation methods, such as
 {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle#asType java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle.asType},
 do not require any access checks, and are used
 independently of any {@code Lookup} object.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If the desired member is {@code protected}, the usual JVM rules apply,
 including the requirement that the lookup class must be either be in the
 same package as the desired member, or must inherit that member.
 (See the Java Virtual Machine Specification, sections 4.9.2, 5.4.3.5, and 6.4.)
 In addition, if the desired member is a non-static field or method
 in a different package, the resulting method handle may only be applied
 to objects of the lookup class or one of its subclasses.
 This requirement is enforced by narrowing the type of the leading
 {@code this} parameter from {@code C}
 (which will necessarily be a superclass of the lookup class)
 to the lookup class itself.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The JVM imposes a similar requirement on {@code invokespecial} instruction,
 that the receiver argument must match both the resolved method &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;
 the current class.  Again, this requirement is enforced by narrowing the
 type of the leading parameter to the resulting method handle.
 (See the Java Virtual Machine Specification, section 4.10.1.9.)
 &lt;p&gt;
 The JVM represents constructors and static initializer blocks as internal methods
 with special names ({@code &quot;&lt;init&gt;&quot;} and {@code &quot;&lt;clinit&gt;&quot;}).
 The internal syntax of invocation instructions allows them to refer to such internal
 methods as if they were normal methods, but the JVM bytecode verifier rejects them.
 A lookup of such an internal method will produce a {@code NoSuchMethodException}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In some cases, access between nested classes is obtained by the Java compiler by creating
 an wrapper method to access a private method of another class
 in the same top-level declaration.
 For example, a nested class {@code C.D}
 can access private members within other related classes such as
 {@code C}, {@code C.D.E}, or {@code C.B},
 but the Java compiler may need to generate wrapper methods in
 those related classes.  In such cases, a {@code Lookup} object on
 {@code C.E} would be unable to those private members.
 A workaround for this limitation is the {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#in java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup.in} method,
 which can transform a lookup on {@code C.E} into one on any of those other
 classes, without special elevation of privilege.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The accesses permitted to a given lookup object may be limited,
 according to its set of {@link #lookupModes lookupModes},
 to a subset of members normally accessible to the lookup class.
 For example, the {@link #publicLookup publicLookup}
 method produces a lookup object which is only allowed to access
 public members in public classes.
 The caller sensitive method {@link #lookup lookup}
 produces a lookup object with full capabilities relative to
 its caller class, to emulate all supported bytecode behaviors.
 Also, the {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#in java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup.in} method may produce a lookup object
 with fewer access modes than the original lookup object.

 &lt;p style=&quot;font-size:smaller;&quot;&gt;
 &lt;a name=&quot;privacc&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;em&gt;Discussion of private access:&lt;/em&gt;
 We say that a lookup has &lt;em&gt;private access&lt;/em&gt;
 if its {@linkplain #lookupModes lookup modes}
 include the possibility of accessing {@code private} members.
 As documented in the relevant methods elsewhere,
 only lookups with private access possess the following capabilities:
 &lt;ul style=&quot;font-size:smaller;&quot;&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;access private fields, methods, and constructors of the lookup class
 &lt;li&gt;create method handles which invoke &lt;a href=&quot;MethodHandles.Lookup.html#callsens&quot;&gt;caller sensitive&lt;/a&gt; methods,
     such as {@code Class.forName}
 &lt;li&gt;create method handles which {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#findSpecial emulate invokespecial} instructions
 &lt;li&gt;avoid &lt;a href=&quot;MethodHandles.Lookup.html#secmgr&quot;&gt;package access checks&lt;/a&gt;
     for classes accessible to the lookup class
 &lt;li&gt;create {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#in delegated lookup objects} which have private access to other classes
     within the same package member
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;p style=&quot;font-size:smaller;&quot;&gt;
 Each of these permissions is a consequence of the fact that a lookup object
 with private access can be securely traced back to an originating class,
 whose &lt;a href=&quot;MethodHandles.Lookup.html#equiv&quot;&gt;bytecode behaviors&lt;/a&gt; and Java language access permissions
 can be reliably determined and emulated by method handles.

 &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;secmgr&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Security manager interactions&lt;/h1&gt;
 Although bytecode instructions can only refer to classes in
 a related class loader, this API can search for methods in any
 class, as long as a reference to its {@code Class} object is
 available.  Such cross-loader references are also possible with the
 Core Reflection API, and are impossible to bytecode instructions
 such as {@code invokestatic} or {@code getfield}.
 There is a {@linkplain java.lang.SecurityManager security manager API}
 to allow applications to check such cross-loader references.
 These checks apply to both the {@code MethodHandles.Lookup} API
 and the Core Reflection API
 (as found on {@link java.lang.Class Class}).
 &lt;p&gt;
 If a security manager is present, member lookups are subject to
 additional checks.
 From one to three calls are made to the security manager.
 Any of these calls can refuse access by throwing a
 {@link java.lang.SecurityException SecurityException}.
 Define {@code smgr} as the security manager,
 {@code lookc} as the lookup class of the current lookup object,
 {@code refc} as the containing class in which the member
 is being sought, and {@code defc} as the class in which the
 member is actually defined.
 The value {@code lookc} is defined as &lt;em&gt;not present&lt;/em&gt;
 if the current lookup object does not have
 &lt;a href=&quot;MethodHandles.Lookup.html#privacc&quot;&gt;private access&lt;/a&gt;.
 The calls are made according to the following rules:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1:&lt;/b&gt;
     If {@code lookc} is not present, or if its class loader is not
     the same as or an ancestor of the class loader of {@code refc},
     then {@link SecurityManager#checkPackageAccess
     smgr.checkPackageAccess(refcPkg)} is called,
     where {@code refcPkg} is the package of {@code refc}.
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2:&lt;/b&gt;
     If the retrieved member is not public and
     {@code lookc} is not present, then
     {@link SecurityManager#checkPermission smgr.checkPermission}
     with {@code RuntimePermission(&quot;accessDeclaredMembers&quot;)} is called.
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 3:&lt;/b&gt;
     If the retrieved member is not public,
     and if {@code lookc} is not present,
     and if {@code defc} and {@code refc} are different,
     then {@link SecurityManager#checkPackageAccess
     smgr.checkPackageAccess(defcPkg)} is called,
     where {@code defcPkg} is the package of {@code defc}.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 Security checks are performed after other access checks have passed.
 Therefore, the above rules presuppose a member that is public,
 or else that is being accessed from a lookup class that has
 rights to access the member.

 &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;callsens&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Caller sensitive methods&lt;/h1&gt;
 A small number of Java methods have a special property called caller sensitivity.
 A &lt;em&gt;caller-sensitive&lt;/em&gt; method can behave differently depending on the
 identity of its immediate caller.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If a method handle for a caller-sensitive method is requested,
 the general rules for &lt;a href=&quot;MethodHandles.Lookup.html#equiv&quot;&gt;bytecode behaviors&lt;/a&gt; apply,
 but they take account of the lookup class in a special way.
 The resulting method handle behaves as if it were called
 from an instruction contained in the lookup class,
 so that the caller-sensitive method detects the lookup class.
 (By contrast, the invoker of the method handle is disregarded.)
 Thus, in the case of caller-sensitive methods,
 different lookup classes may give rise to
 differently behaving method handles.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In cases where the lookup object is
 {@link #publicLookup publicLookup()},
 or some other lookup object without
 &lt;a href=&quot;MethodHandles.Lookup.html#privacc&quot;&gt;private access&lt;/a&gt;,
 the lookup class is disregarded.
 In such cases, no caller-sensitive method handle can be created,
 access is forbidden, and the lookup fails with an
 {@code IllegalAccessException}.
 &lt;p style=&quot;font-size:smaller;&quot;&gt;
 &lt;em&gt;Discussion:&lt;/em&gt;
 For example, the caller-sensitive method
 {@link java.lang.Class#forName(String) Class.forName(x)}
 can return varying classes or throw varying exceptions,
 depending on the class loader of the class that calls it.
 A public lookup of {@code Class.forName} will fail, because
 there is no reasonable way to determine its bytecode behavior.
 &lt;p style=&quot;font-size:smaller;&quot;&gt;
 If an application caches method handles for broad sharing,
 it should use {@code publicLookup()} to create them.
 If there is a lookup of {@code Class.forName}, it will fail,
 and the application must take appropriate action in that case.
 It may be that a later lookup, perhaps during the invocation of a
 bootstrap method, can incorporate the specific identity
 of the caller, making the method accessible.
 &lt;p style=&quot;font-size:smaller;&quot;&gt;
 The function {@code MethodHandles.lookup} is caller sensitive
 so that there can be a secure foundation for lookups.
 Nearly all other methods in the JSR 292 API rely on lookup
 objects to check access requests.

 &lt;li&gt;If no access is allowed, the suffix is &quot;/noaccess&quot;.
 &lt;li&gt;If only public access is allowed, the suffix is &quot;/public&quot;.
 &lt;li&gt;If only public and package access are allowed, the suffix is &quot;/package&quot;.
 &lt;li&gt;If only public, package, and private access are allowed, the suffix is &quot;/private&quot;.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 If none of the above cases apply, it is the case that full
 access (public, package, private, and protected) is allowed.
 In this case, no suffix is added.
 This is true only of an object obtained originally from
 {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles#lookup MethodHandles.lookup}.
 Objects created by {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#in Lookup.in}
 always have restricted access, and will display a suffix.
 &lt;p&gt;
 (It may seem strange that protected access should be
 stronger than private access.  Viewed independently from
 package access, protected access is the first to be lost,
 because it requires a direct subclass relationship between
 caller and callee.)
