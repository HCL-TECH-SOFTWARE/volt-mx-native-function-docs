</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 A VarHandle is a dynamically strongly typed reference to a variable, or to a
 parametrically-defined family of variables, including static fields,
 non-static fields, array elements, or components of an off-heap data
 structure.  Access to such variables is supported under various
 &lt;em&gt;access modes&lt;/em&gt;, including plain read/write access, volatile
 read/write access, and compare-and-swap.

 &lt;p&gt;VarHandles are immutable and have no visible state.  VarHandles cannot be
 subclassed by the user.

 &lt;p&gt;A VarHandle has:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;a {@link #varType variable type} T, the type of every variable referenced
 by this VarHandle; and
 &lt;li&gt;a list of {@link #coordinateTypes coordinate types}
 {@code CT1, CT2, ..., CTn}, the types of &lt;em&gt;coordinate expressions&lt;/em&gt; that
 jointly locate a variable referenced by this VarHandle.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 Variable and coordinate types may be primitive or reference, and are
 represented by {@code Class} objects.  The list of coordinate types may be
 empty.

 &lt;p&gt;Factory methods that produce or {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup
 lookup} VarHandle instances document the supported variable type and the list
 of coordinate types.

 &lt;p&gt;Each access mode is associated with one &lt;em&gt;access mode method&lt;/em&gt;, a
 &lt;a href=&quot;MethodHandle.html#sigpoly&quot;&gt;signature polymorphic&lt;/a&gt; method named
 for the access mode.  When an access mode method is invoked on a VarHandle
 instance, the initial arguments to the invocation are coordinate expressions
 that indicate in precisely which object the variable is to be accessed.
 Trailing arguments to the invocation represent values of importance to the
 access mode.  For example, the various compare-and-set or compare-and-exchange
 access modes require two trailing arguments for the variable's expected value
 and new value.

 &lt;p&gt;The arity and types of arguments to the invocation of an access mode
 method are not checked statically.  Instead, each access mode method
 specifies an {@link #accessModeType(AccessMode) access mode type},
 represented as an instance of {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodType}, that serves as a kind of
 method signature against which the arguments are checked dynamically.  An
 access mode type gives formal parameter types in terms of the coordinate
 types of a VarHandle instance and the types for values of importance to the
 access mode.  An access mode type also gives a return type, often in terms of
 the variable type of a VarHandle instance.  When an access mode method is
 invoked on a VarHandle instance, the symbolic type descriptor at the
 call site, the run time types of arguments to the invocation, and the run
 time type of the return value, must &lt;a href=&quot;#invoke&quot;&gt;match&lt;/a&gt; the types
 given in the access mode type.  A runtime exception will be thrown if the
 match fails.

 For example, the access mode method {@link #compareAndSet} specifies that if
 its receiver is a VarHandle instance with coordinate types
 {@code CT1, ..., CTn} and variable type {@code T}, then its access mode type
 is {@code (CT1 c1, ..., CTn cn, T expectedValue, T newValue)boolean}.
 Suppose that a VarHandle instance can access array elements, and that its
 coordinate types are {@code String[]} and {@code int} while its variable type
 is {@code String}.  The access mode type for {@code compareAndSet} on this
 VarHandle instance would be
 {@code (String[] c1, int c2, String expectedValue, String newValue)boolean}.
 Such a VarHandle instance may produced by the
 {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles#arrayElementVarHandle(Class) array factory method} and
 access array elements as follows:
 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 String[] sa = ...
 VarHandle avh = MethodHandles.arrayElementVarHandle(String[].class);
 boolean r = avh.compareAndSet(sa, 10, &quot;expected&quot;, &quot;new&quot;);
 }&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Access modes control atomicity and consistency properties.
 &lt;em&gt;Plain&lt;/em&gt; read ({@code get}) and write ({@code set})
 accesses are guaranteed to be bitwise atomic only for references
 and for primitive values of at most 32 bits, and impose no observable
 ordering constraints with respect to threads other than the
 executing thread. &lt;em&gt;Opaque&lt;/em&gt; operations are bitwise atomic and
 coherently ordered with respect to accesses to the same variable.
 In addition to obeying Opaque properties, &lt;em&gt;Acquire&lt;/em&gt; mode
 reads and their subsequent accesses are ordered after matching
 &lt;em&gt;Release&lt;/em&gt; mode writes and their previous accesses.  In
 addition to obeying Acquire and Release properties, all
 &lt;em&gt;Volatile&lt;/em&gt; operations are totally ordered with respect to
 each other.

 &lt;p&gt;Access modes are grouped into the following categories:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;read access modes that get the value of a variable under specified
 memory ordering effects.
 The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
 consists of the methods
 {@link #get get},
 {@link #getVolatile getVolatile},
 {@link #getAcquire getAcquire},
 {@link #getOpaque getOpaque}.
 &lt;li&gt;write access modes that set the value of a variable under specified
 memory ordering effects.
 The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
 consists of the methods
 {@link #set set},
 {@link #setVolatile setVolatile},
 {@link #setRelease setRelease},
 {@link #setOpaque setOpaque}.
 &lt;li&gt;atomic update access modes that, for example, atomically compare and set
 the value of a variable under specified memory ordering effects.
 The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
 consists of the methods
 {@link #compareAndSet compareAndSet},
 {@link #weakCompareAndSetPlain weakCompareAndSetPlain},
 {@link #weakCompareAndSet weakCompareAndSet},
 {@link #weakCompareAndSetAcquire weakCompareAndSetAcquire},
 {@link #weakCompareAndSetRelease weakCompareAndSetRelease},
 {@link #compareAndExchangeAcquire compareAndExchangeAcquire},
 {@link #compareAndExchange compareAndExchange},
 {@link #compareAndExchangeRelease compareAndExchangeRelease},
 {@link #getAndSet getAndSet},
 {@link #getAndSetAcquire getAndSetAcquire},
 {@link #getAndSetRelease getAndSetRelease}.
 &lt;li&gt;numeric atomic update access modes that, for example, atomically get and
 set with addition the value of a variable under specified memory ordering
 effects.
 The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
 consists of the methods
 {@link #getAndAdd getAndAdd},
 {@link #getAndAddAcquire getAndAddAcquire},
 {@link #getAndAddRelease getAndAddRelease},
 &lt;li&gt;bitwise atomic update access modes that, for example, atomically get and
 bitwise OR the value of a variable under specified memory ordering
 effects.
 The set of corresponding access mode methods belonging to this group
 consists of the methods
 {@link #getAndBitwiseOr getAndBitwiseOr},
 {@link #getAndBitwiseOrAcquire getAndBitwiseOrAcquire},
 {@link #getAndBitwiseOrRelease getAndBitwiseOrRelease},
 {@link #getAndBitwiseAnd getAndBitwiseAnd},
 {@link #getAndBitwiseAndAcquire getAndBitwiseAndAcquire},
 {@link #getAndBitwiseAndRelease getAndBitwiseAndRelease},
 {@link #getAndBitwiseXor getAndBitwiseXor},
 {@link #getAndBitwiseXorAcquire getAndBitwiseXorAcquire},
 {@link #getAndBitwiseXorRelease getAndBitwiseXorRelease}.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Factory methods that produce or {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup
 lookup} VarHandle instances document the set of access modes that are
 supported, which may also include documenting restrictions based on the
 variable type and whether a variable is read-only.  If an access mode is not
 supported then the corresponding access mode method will on invocation throw
 an {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.  Factory methods should document
 any additional undeclared exceptions that may be thrown by access mode
 methods.
 The {@link #get get} access mode is supported for all
 VarHandle instances and the corresponding method never throws
 {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
 If a VarHandle references a read-only variable (for example a {@code final}
 field) then write, atomic update, numeric atomic update, and bitwise atomic
 update access modes are not supported and corresponding methods throw
 {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
 Read/write access modes (if supported), with the exception of
 {@code get} and {@code set}, provide atomic access for
 reference types and all primitive types.
 Unless stated otherwise in the documentation of a factory method, the access
 modes {@code get} and {@code set} (if supported) provide atomic access for
 reference types and all primitives types, with the exception of {@code long}
 and {@code double} on 32-bit platforms.

 &lt;p&gt;Access modes will override any memory ordering effects specified at
 the declaration site of a variable.  For example, a VarHandle accessing a
 a field using the {@code get} access mode will access the field as
 specified &lt;em&gt;by its access mode&lt;/em&gt; even if that field is declared
 {@code volatile}.  When mixed access is performed extreme care should be
 taken since the Java Memory Model may permit surprising results.

 &lt;p&gt;In addition to supporting access to variables under various access modes,
 a set of static methods, referred to as memory fence methods, is also
 provided for fine-grained control of memory ordering.

 The Java Language Specification permits other threads to observe operations
 as if they were executed in orders different than are apparent in program
 source code, subject to constraints arising, for example, from the use of
 locks, {@code volatile} fields or VarHandles.  The static methods,
 {@link #fullFence fullFence}, {@link #acquireFence acquireFence},
 {@link #releaseFence releaseFence}, {@link #loadLoadFence loadLoadFence} and
 {@link #storeStoreFence storeStoreFence}, can also be used to impose
 constraints.  Their specifications, as is the case for certain access modes,
 are phrased in terms of the lack of &quot;reorderings&quot; -- observable ordering
 effects that might otherwise occur if the fence was not present.  More
 precise phrasing of the specification of access mode methods and memory fence
 methods may accompany future updates of the Java Language Specification.

 &lt;h1&gt;Compiling invocation of access mode methods&lt;/h1&gt;
 A Java method call expression naming an access mode method can invoke a
 VarHandle from Java source code.  From the viewpoint of source code, these
 methods can take any arguments and their polymorphic result (if expressed)
 can be cast to any return type.  Formally this is accomplished by giving the
 access mode methods variable arity {@code Object} arguments and
 {@code Object} return types (if the return type is polymorphic), but they
 have an additional quality called &lt;em&gt;signature polymorphism&lt;/em&gt; which
 connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.
 &lt;p&gt;
 As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to access mode methods
 compile to an {@code invokevirtual} instruction.  More unusually, the
 compiler must record the actual argument types, and may not perform method
 invocation conversions on the arguments.  Instead, it must generate
 instructions to push them on the stack according to their own unconverted
 types.  The VarHandle object itself will be pushed on the stack before the
 arguments.  The compiler then generates an {@code invokevirtual} instruction
 that invokes the access mode method with a symbolic type descriptor which
 describes the argument and return types.
 &lt;p&gt;
 To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also
 determine the return type (if polymorphic).  This is based on a cast on the
 method invocation expression, if there is one, or else {@code Object} if the
 invocation is an expression, or else {@code void} if the invocation is a
 statement.  The cast may be to a primitive type (but not {@code void}).
 &lt;p&gt;
 As a corner case, an uncasted {@code null} argument is given a symbolic type
 descriptor of {@code java.lang.Void}.  The ambiguity with the type
 {@code Void} is harmless, since there are no references of type {@code Void}
 except the null reference.


 &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;invoke&quot;&gt;Performing invocation of access mode methods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
 The first time an {@code invokevirtual} instruction is executed it is linked
 by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction and verifying that
 the method call is statically legal.  This also holds for calls to access mode
 methods.  In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler
 is checked for correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved.  Thus, an
 {@code invokevirtual} instruction which invokes an access mode method will
 always link, as long as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically
 well-formed and the types exist.
 &lt;p&gt;
 When the {@code invokevirtual} is executed after linking, the receiving
 VarHandle's access mode type is first checked by the JVM to ensure that it
 matches the symbolic type descriptor.  If the type
 match fails, it means that the access mode method which the caller is
 invoking is not present on the individual VarHandle being invoked.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Invocation of an access mode method behaves as if an invocation of
 {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle#invoke}, where the receiving method handle accepts the
 VarHandle instance as the leading argument.  More specifically, the
 following, where {@code {access-mode}} corresponds to the access mode method
 name:
 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 VarHandle vh = ..
 R r = (R) vh.{access-mode}(p1, p2, ..., pN);
 }&lt;/pre&gt;
 behaves as if:
 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 VarHandle vh = ..
 VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName(&quot;{access-mode}&quot;);
 MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.varHandleExactInvoker(
                       am,
                       vh.accessModeType(am));

 R r = (R) mh.invoke(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
 }&lt;/pre&gt;
 (modulo access mode methods do not declare throwing of {@code Throwable}).
 This is equivalent to:
 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.lookup().findVirtual(
                       VarHandle.class,
                       &quot;{access-mode}&quot;,
                       MethodType.methodType(R, p1, p2, ..., pN));

 R r = (R) mh.invokeExact(vh, p1, p2, ..., pN)
 }&lt;/pre&gt;
 where the desired method type is the symbolic type descriptor and a
 {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle#invokeExact} is performed, since before invocation of the
 target, the handle will apply reference casts as necessary and box, unbox, or
 widen primitive values, as if by {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle#asType asType} (see also
 {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles#varHandleInvoker}).

 More concisely, such behaviour is equivalent to:
 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 VarHandle vh = ..
 VarHandle.AccessMode am = VarHandle.AccessMode.valueFromMethodName(&quot;{access-mode}&quot;);
 MethodHandle mh = vh.toMethodHandle(am);

 R r = (R) mh.invoke(p1, p2, ..., pN)
 }&lt;/pre&gt;
 Where, in this case, the method handle is bound to the VarHandle instance.


 &lt;h1&gt;Invocation checking&lt;/h1&gt;
 In typical programs, VarHandle access mode type matching will usually
 succeed.  But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a
 {@link java.lang.invoke.WrongMethodTypeException}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Thus, an access mode type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
 in a statically typed program can show up as a dynamic
 {@code WrongMethodTypeException} in a program which uses VarHandles.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Because access mode types contain &quot;live&quot; {@code Class} objects, method type
 matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
 Thus, even if a VarHandle {@code VH} is created in one class loader
 {@code L1} and used in another {@code L2}, VarHandle access mode method
 calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type descriptor, as
 resolved in {@code L2}, is matched against the original callee method's
 symbolic type descriptor, as resolved in {@code L1}.  The resolution in
 {@code L1} happens when {@code VH} is created and its access mode types are
 assigned, while the resolution in {@code L2} happens when the
 {@code invokevirtual} instruction is linked.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Apart from type descriptor checks, a VarHandles's capability to
 access it's variables is unrestricted.
 If a VarHandle is formed on a non-public variable by a class that has access
 to that variable, the resulting VarHandle can be used in any place by any
 caller who receives a reference to it.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time a
 reflective method is invoked, VarHandle access checking is performed
 &lt;a href=&quot;MethodHandles.Lookup.html#access&quot;&gt;when the VarHandle is
 created&lt;/a&gt;.
 Thus, VarHandles to non-public variables, or to variables in non-public
 classes, should generally be kept secret.  They should not be passed to
 untrusted code unless their use from the untrusted code would be harmless.


 &lt;h1&gt;VarHandle creation&lt;/h1&gt;
 Java code can create a VarHandle that directly accesses any field that is
 accessible to that code.  This is done via a reflective, capability-based
 API called {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup
 MethodHandles.Lookup}.
 For example, a VarHandle for a non-static field can be obtained
 from {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#findVarHandle
 Lookup.findVarHandle}.
 There is also a conversion method from Core Reflection API objects,
 {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#unreflectVarHandle
 Lookup.unreflectVarHandle}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Access to protected field members is restricted to receivers only of the
 accessing class, or one of its subclasses, and the accessing class must in
 turn be a subclass (or package sibling) of the protected member's defining
 class.  If a VarHandle refers to a protected non-static field of a declaring
 class outside the current package, the receiver argument will be narrowed to
 the type of the accessing class.

 &lt;h1&gt;Interoperation between VarHandles and the Core Reflection API&lt;/h1&gt;
 Using factory methods in the {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup
 Lookup} API, any field represented by a Core Reflection API object
 can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent VarHandle.
 For example, a reflective {@link java.lang.reflect.Field Field} can
 be converted to a VarHandle using
 {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#unreflectVarHandle
 Lookup.unreflectVarHandle}.
 The resulting VarHandles generally provide more direct and efficient
 access to the underlying fields.
 &lt;p&gt;
 As a special case, when the Core Reflection API is used to view the
 signature polymorphic access mode methods in this class, they appear as
 ordinary non-polymorphic methods.  Their reflective appearance, as viewed by
 {@link java.lang.Class#getDeclaredMethod Class.getDeclaredMethod},
 is unaffected by their special status in this API.
 For example, {@link java.lang.reflect.Method#getModifiers
 Method.getModifiers}
 will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
 declared method, including in this case {@code native} and {@code varargs}
 bits.
 &lt;p&gt;
 As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be invoked
 directly via {@link java.lang.reflect.Method#invoke java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke},
 via JNI, or indirectly via
 {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#unreflect Lookup.unreflect}.
 However, such reflective calls do not result in access mode method
 invocations.  Such a call, if passed the required argument (a single one, of
 type {@code Object[]}), will ignore the argument and will throw an
 {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Since {@code invokevirtual} instructions can natively invoke VarHandle
 access mode methods under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view
 conflicts with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
 Thus, these native methods, when reflectively viewed by
 {@code Class.getDeclaredMethod}, may be regarded as placeholders only.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular access mode type,
 use {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles#varHandleExactInvoker} or
 {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles#varHandleInvoker}.  The
 {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#findVirtual Lookup.findVirtual}
 API is also able to return a method handle to call an access mode method for
 any specified access mode type and is equivalent in behaviour to
 {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles#varHandleInvoker}.

 &lt;h1&gt;Interoperation between VarHandles and Java generics&lt;/h1&gt;
 A VarHandle can be obtained for a variable, such as a a field, which is
 declared with Java generic types.  As with the Core Reflection API, the
 VarHandle's variable type will be constructed from the erasure of the
 source-level type.  When a VarHandle access mode method is invoked, the
 types
 of its arguments or the return value cast type may be generic types or type
 instances.  If this occurs, the compiler will replace those types by their
 erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor for the
 {@code invokevirtual} instruction.
