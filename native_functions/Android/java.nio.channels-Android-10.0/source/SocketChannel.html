 implements java.nio.channels.ScatteringByteChannel

 implements java.nio.channels.GatheringByteChannel

 implements java.nio.channels.NetworkChannel

@extends java.nio.channels.spi.AbstractSelectableChannel

 A selectable channel for stream-oriented connecting sockets.

 &lt;p&gt; A socket channel is created by invoking one of the {@link #open open}
 methods of this class.  It is not possible to create a channel for an arbitrary,
 pre-existing socket. A newly-created socket channel is open but not yet
 connected.  An attempt to invoke an I/O operation upon an unconnected
 channel will cause a {@link java.nio.channels.NotYetConnectedException} to be thrown.  A
 socket channel can be connected by invoking its {@link #connect connect}
 method; once connected, a socket channel remains connected until it is
 closed.  Whether or not a socket channel is connected may be determined by
 invoking its {@link #isConnected isConnected} method.

 &lt;p&gt; Socket channels support &lt;i&gt;non-blocking connection:&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;A socket
 channel may be created and the process of establishing the link to the
 remote socket may be initiated via the {@link #connect connect} method for
 later completion by the {@link #finishConnect finishConnect} method.
 Whether or not a connection operation is in progress may be determined by
 invoking the {@link #isConnectionPending isConnectionPending} method.

 &lt;p&gt; Socket channels support &lt;i&gt;asynchronous shutdown,&lt;/i&gt; which is similar
 to the asynchronous close operation specified in the {@link java.nio.channels.Channel} class.
 If the input side of a socket is shut down by one thread while another
 thread is blocked in a read operation on the socket's channel, then the read
 operation in the blocked thread will complete without reading any bytes and
 will return &lt;tt&gt;-1&lt;/tt&gt;.  If the output side of a socket is shut down by one
 thread while another thread is blocked in a write operation on the socket's
 channel, then the blocked thread will receive an {@link java.nio.channels.AsynchronousCloseException}.

 &lt;p&gt; Socket options are configured using the {@link #setOption(SocketOption,Object)
 setOption} method. Socket channels support the following options:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;table border summary=&quot;Socket options&quot;&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;th&gt;Option Name&lt;/th&gt;
     &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_SNDBUF SO_SNDBUF} &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; The size of the socket send buffer &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF} &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; The size of the socket receive buffer &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_KEEPALIVE SO_KEEPALIVE} &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; Keep connection alive &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR} &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; Re-use address &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_LINGER SO_LINGER} &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; Linger on close if data is present (when configured in blocking mode
          only) &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#TCP_NODELAY TCP_NODELAY} &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; Disable the Nagle algorithm &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.

 &lt;p&gt; Socket channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.  They
 support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one thread may be
 reading and at most one thread may be writing at any given time.  The {@link #connect connect} and {@link #finishConnect finishConnect} methods are
 mutually synchronized against each other, and an attempt to initiate a read
 or write operation while an invocation of one of these methods is in
 progress will block until that invocation is complete.  &lt;/p&gt;
