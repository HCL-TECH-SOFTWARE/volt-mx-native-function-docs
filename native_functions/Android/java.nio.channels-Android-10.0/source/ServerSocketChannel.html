</span> implements java.nio.channels.NetworkChannel

@extends java.nio.channels.spi.AbstractSelectableChannel

 A selectable channel for stream-oriented listening sockets.

 &lt;p&gt; A server-socket channel is created by invoking the {@link #open() open}
 method of this class.  It is not possible to create a channel for an arbitrary,
 pre-existing {@link ServerSocket}. A newly-created server-socket channel is
 open but not yet bound.  An attempt to invoke the {@link #accept() accept}
 method of an unbound server-socket channel will cause a {@link java.nio.channels.NotYetBoundException}
 to be thrown. A server-socket channel can be bound by invoking one of the
 {@link #bind(java.net.SocketAddress,int) bind} methods defined by this class.

 &lt;p&gt; Socket options are configured using the {@link #setOption(SocketOption,Object)
 setOption} method. Server-socket channels support the following options:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;table border summary=&quot;Socket options&quot;&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;th&gt;Option Name&lt;/th&gt;
     &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF} &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; The size of the socket receive buffer &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR} &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; Re-use address &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.

 &lt;p&gt; Server-socket channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
 &lt;/p&gt;
