</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 This class provides access to the system alarm services.  These allow you
 to schedule your application to be run at some point in the future.  When
 an alarm goes off, the {@link Intent} that had been registered for it
 is broadcast by the system, automatically starting the target application
 if it is not already running.  Registered alarms are retained while the
 device is asleep (and can optionally wake the device up if they go off
 during that time), but will be cleared if it is turned off and rebooted.

 &lt;p&gt;The Alarm Manager holds a CPU wake lock as long as the alarm receiver's
 onReceive() method is executing. This guarantees that the phone will not sleep
 until you have finished handling the broadcast. Once onReceive() returns, the
 Alarm Manager releases this wake lock. This means that the phone will in some
 cases sleep as soon as your onReceive() method completes.  If your alarm receiver
 called {@link android.content.Context#startService Context.startService()}, it
 is possible that the phone will sleep before the requested service is launched.
 To prevent this, your BroadcastReceiver and Service will need to implement a
 separate wake lock policy to ensure that the phone continues running until the
 service becomes available.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: The Alarm Manager is intended for cases where you want to have
 your application code run at a specific time, even if your application is
 not currently running.  For normal timing operations (ticks, timeouts,
 etc) it is easier and much more efficient to use
 {@link android.os.Handler}.&lt;/b&gt;

 &lt;p class=&quot;caution&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Beginning with API 19
 ({@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#KITKAT}) alarm delivery is inexact:
 the OS will shift alarms in order to minimize wakeups and battery use.  There are
 new APIs to support applications which need strict delivery guarantees; see
 {@link #setWindow(int, long, long, android.app.PendingIntent)} and
 {@link #setExact(int, long, android.app.PendingIntent)}.  Applications whose {@code targetSdkVersion}
 is earlier than API 19 will continue to see the previous behavior in which all
 alarms are delivered exactly when requested.

 If there is already an alarm scheduled for the same IntentSender, that previous
 alarm will first be canceled.

 &lt;p&gt;If the stated trigger time is in the past, the alarm will be triggered
 immediately.  If there is already an alarm for this Intent
 scheduled (with the equality of two intents being defined by
 {@link Intent#filterEquals}), then it will be removed and replaced by
 this one.

 &lt;p&gt;
 The alarm is an Intent broadcast that goes to a broadcast receiver that
 you registered with {@link android.content.Context#registerReceiver}
 or through the &amp;lt;receiver&amp;gt; tag in an AndroidManifest.xml file.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Alarm intents are delivered with a data extra of type int called
 {@link Intent#EXTRA_ALARM_COUNT Intent.EXTRA_ALARM_COUNT} that indicates
 how many past alarm events have been accumulated into this intent
 broadcast.  Recurring alarms that have gone undelivered because the
 phone was asleep may have a count greater than one when delivered.

 &lt;div class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Beginning in API 19, the trigger time passed to this method
 is treated as inexact: the alarm will not be delivered before this time, but
 may be deferred and delivered some time later.  The OS will use
 this policy in order to &quot;batch&quot; alarms together across the entire system,
 minimizing the number of times the device needs to &quot;wake up&quot; and minimizing
 battery use.  In general, alarms scheduled in the near future will not
 be deferred as long as alarms scheduled far in the future.

 &lt;p&gt;
 With the new batching policy, delivery ordering guarantees are not as
 strong as they were previously.  If the application sets multiple alarms,
 it is possible that these alarms' &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; delivery ordering may not match
 the order of their &lt;em&gt;requested&lt;/em&gt; delivery times.  If your application has
 strong ordering requirements there are other APIs that you can use to get
 the necessary behavior; see {@link #setWindow(int, long, long, android.app.PendingIntent)}
 and {@link #setExact(int, long, android.app.PendingIntent)}.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Applications whose {@code targetSdkVersion} is before API 19 will

 for the same IntentSender, it will first be canceled.

 &lt;p&gt;Like {@link #set}, except you can also supply a period at which
 the alarm will automatically repeat.  This alarm continues
 repeating until explicitly removed with {@link #cancel}.  If the stated
 trigger time is in the past, the alarm will be triggered immediately, with an
 alarm count depending on how far in the past the trigger time is relative
 to the repeat interval.

 &lt;p&gt;If an alarm is delayed (by system sleep, for example, for non
 _WAKEUP alarm types), a skipped repeat will be delivered as soon as
 possible.  After that, future alarms will be delivered according to the
 original schedule; they do not drift over time.  For example, if you have
 set a recurring alarm for the top of every hour but the phone was asleep
 from 7:45 until 8:45, an alarm will be sent as soon as the phone awakens,
 then the next alarm will be sent at 9:00.

 &lt;p&gt;If your application wants to allow the delivery times to drift in
 order to guarantee that at least a certain time interval always elapses
 between alarms, then the approach to take is to use one-time alarms,
 scheduling the next one yourself when handling each alarm delivery.

 &lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; as of API 19, all repeating alarms are inexact.  If your
 application needs precise delivery times then it must use one-time

 avoiding waking the device from sleep more than necessary.

</span> even when the system is in low-power idle modes.  If you don't need exact scheduling of
 the alarm but still need to execute while idle, consider using
 {@link #setAndAllowWhileIdle}.  This type of alarm must &lt;b&gt;only&lt;/b&gt;
 be used for situations where it is actually required that the alarm go off while in
 idle -- a reasonable example would be for a calendar notification that should make a
 sound so the user is aware of it.  When the alarm is dispatched, the app will also be
 added to the system's temporary whitelist for approximately 10 seconds to allow that
 application to acquire further wake locks in which to complete its work.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;These alarms can significantly impact the power use
 of the device when idle (and thus cause significant battery blame to the app scheduling
 them), so they should be used with care.  To reduce abuse, there are restrictions on how
 frequently these alarms will go off for a particular application.
 Under normal system operation, it will not dispatch these
 alarms more than about every minute (at which point every such pending alarm is
 dispatched); when in low-power idle modes this duration may be significantly longer,
 such as 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Unlike other alarms, the system is free to reschedule this type of alarm to happen
 out of order with any other alarms, even those from the same app.  This will clearly happen
 when the device is idle (since this alarm can go off while idle, when any other alarms
 from the app will be held until later), but may also happen even when not idle.
 Note that the OS will allow itself more flexibility for scheduling these alarms than
 regular exact alarms, since the application has opted into this behavior.  When the
 device is idle it may take even more liberties with scheduling in order to optimize
 for battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
