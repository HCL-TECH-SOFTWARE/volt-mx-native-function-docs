 Parameters used as input for the PKIX {@code CertPathBuilder}
 algorithm.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A PKIX {@code CertPathBuilder} uses these parameters to {@link java.security.cert.CertPathBuilder#build build} a {@code CertPath} which has been
 validated according to the PKIX certification path validation algorithm.

 &lt;p&gt;To instantiate a {@code PKIXBuilderParameters} object, an
 application must specify one or more &lt;i&gt;most-trusted CAs&lt;/i&gt; as defined by
 the PKIX certification path validation algorithm. The most-trusted CA
 can be specified using one of two constructors. An application
 can call {@link #PKIXBuilderParameters(Set, java.security.cert.CertSelector)
 PKIXBuilderParameters(Set, java.security.cert.CertSelector)}, specifying a
 {@code Set} of {@code TrustAnchor} objects, each of which
 identifies a most-trusted CA. Alternatively, an application can call
 {@link #PKIXBuilderParameters(KeyStore, java.security.cert.CertSelector)
 PKIXBuilderParameters(KeyStore, java.security.cert.CertSelector)}, specifying a
 {@code KeyStore} instance containing trusted certificate entries, each
 of which will be considered as a most-trusted CA.

 &lt;p&gt;In addition, an application must specify constraints on the target
 certificate that the {@code CertPathBuilder} will attempt
 to build a path to. The constraints are specified as a
 {@code CertSelector} object. These constraints should provide the
 {@code CertPathBuilder} with enough search criteria to find the target
 certificate. Minimal criteria for an {@code X509Certificate} usually
 include the subject name and/or one or more subject alternative names.
 If enough criteria is not specified, the {@code CertPathBuilder}
 may throw a {@code CertPathBuilderException}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Concurrent Access&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not
 thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single
 object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and
 provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating
 separate objects need not synchronize.

<span id='java-security-cert-PKIXBuilderParameters-method-setMaxPathLength'>/**Sets the value of the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate

 is self-issued if the DNs that appear in the subject and issuer
 fields are identical and are not empty. Note that the last certificate
 in a certification path is not an intermediate certificate, and is not
 included in this limit. Usually the last certificate is an end entity
 certificate, but it can be a CA certificate. A PKIX
 {@code CertPathBuilder} instance must not build
 paths longer than the length specified.

 &lt;p&gt; A value of 0 implies that the path can only contain
 a single certificate. A value of -1 implies that the
 path length is unconstrained (i.e. there is no maximum).
 The default maximum path length, if not specified, is 5.
 Setting a value less than -1 will cause an exception to be thrown.

 &lt;p&gt; If any of the CA certificates contain the
 {@code BasicConstraintsExtension}, the value of the
 {@code pathLenConstraint} field of the extension overrides
 the maximum path length parameter whenever the result is a
 certification path of smaller length.
