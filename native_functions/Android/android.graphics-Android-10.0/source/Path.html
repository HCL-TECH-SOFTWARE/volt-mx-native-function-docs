 The Path class encapsulates compound (multiple contour) geometric paths
 consisting of straight line segments, quadratic curves, and cubic curves.
 It can be drawn with canvas.drawPath(path, paint), either filled or stroked
 (based on the paint's Style), or it can be used for clipping or to draw
 text on a path.
