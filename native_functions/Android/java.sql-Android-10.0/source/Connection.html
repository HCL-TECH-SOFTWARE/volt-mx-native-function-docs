</span> implements java.sql.Wrapper

 implements java.lang.AutoCloseable

 &lt;P&gt;A connection (session) with a specific
 database. SQL statements are executed and results are returned
 within the context of a connection.
 &lt;P&gt;
 A &lt;code&gt;Connection&lt;/code&gt; object's database is able to provide information
 describing its tables, its supported SQL grammar, its stored
 procedures, the capabilities of this connection, and so on. This
 information is obtained with the &lt;code&gt;getMetaData&lt;/code&gt; method.

 &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Note:&lt;/B&gt; When configuring a &lt;code&gt;Connection&lt;/code&gt;, JDBC applications
  should use the appropriate &lt;code&gt;Connection&lt;/code&gt; method such as
  &lt;code&gt;setAutoCommit&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;setTransactionIsolation&lt;/code&gt;.
  Applications should not invoke SQL commands directly to change the connection's
   configuration when there is a JDBC method available.  By default a &lt;code&gt;Connection&lt;/code&gt; object is in
 auto-commit mode, which means that it automatically commits changes
 after executing each statement. If auto-commit mode has been
 disabled, the method &lt;code&gt;commit&lt;/code&gt; must be called explicitly in
 order to commit changes; otherwise, database changes will not be saved.
 &lt;P&gt;
 A new &lt;code&gt;Connection&lt;/code&gt; object created using the JDBC 2.1 core API
 has an initially empty type map associated with it. A user may enter a
 custom mapping for a UDT in this type map.
 When a UDT is retrieved from a data source with the
 method &lt;code&gt;ResultSet.getObject&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;getObject&lt;/code&gt; method
 will check the connection's type map to see if there is an entry for that
 UDT.  If so, the &lt;code&gt;getObject&lt;/code&gt; method will map the UDT to the
 class indicated.  If there is no entry, the UDT will be mapped using the
 standard mapping.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A user may create a new type map, which is a &lt;code&gt;java.util.Map&lt;/code&gt;
 object, make an entry in it, and pass it to the &lt;code&gt;java.sql&lt;/code&gt;
 methods that can perform custom mapping.  In this case, the method
 will use the given type map instead of the one associated with
 the connection.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For example, the following code fragment specifies that the SQL
 type &lt;code&gt;ATHLETES&lt;/code&gt; will be mapped to the class
 &lt;code&gt;Athletes&lt;/code&gt; in the Java programming language.
 The code fragment retrieves the type map for the &lt;code&gt;Connection
 &lt;/code&gt; object &lt;code&gt;con&lt;/code&gt;, inserts the entry into it, and then sets
 the type map with the new entry as the connection's type map.
 &lt;pre&gt;
      java.util.Map map = con.getTypeMap();
      map.put(&quot;mySchemaName.ATHLETES&quot;, Class.forName(&quot;Athletes&quot;));
      con.setTypeMap(map);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
