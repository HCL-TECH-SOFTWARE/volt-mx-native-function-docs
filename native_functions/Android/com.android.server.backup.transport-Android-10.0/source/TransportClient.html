</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 A {@link com.android.server.backup.transport.TransportClient} manages the connection to an {@link IBackupTransport} service, obtained
 via the {@param bindIntent} parameter provided in the constructor. A {@link com.android.server.backup.transport.TransportClient} is
 responsible for only one connection to the transport service, not more.

 &lt;p&gt;After retrieved using {@link TransportManager#getTransportClient(String, String)}, you can
 call either {@link #connect}(String), if you can block your thread, or {@link #connectAsync(TransportConnectionListener, String)}, otherwise, to obtain a {@link IBackupTransport} instance. It's meant to be passed around as a token to a connected transport.
 When the connection is not needed anymore you should call {@link #unbind}(String) or indirectly
 via {@link TransportManager#disposeOfTransportClient(TransportClient, String)}.

 &lt;p&gt;DO NOT forget to unbind otherwise there will be dangling connections floating around.

 &lt;p&gt;This class is thread-safe.

 &lt;p&gt;Note that being bound is not the same as connected. To be connected you also need to be
 bound. You go from nothing to bound, then to bound and connected. To have a usable transport
 binder instance you need to be connected. This method will attempt to connect and return an
 usable transport binder regardless of the state of the object, it may already be connected,
 or bound but not connected, not bound at all or even unusable.

 &lt;p&gt;So, a {@link Context#bindServiceAsUser(Intent, ServiceConnection, int, UserHandle)} (or
 one of its variants) can be called or not depending on the inner state. However, it won't be
 called again if we're already bound. For example, if one was already requested but the
 framework has not yet returned (meaning we're bound but still trying to connect) it won't
 trigger another one, just piggyback on the original request.

 &lt;p&gt;It's guaranteed that you are going to get a call back to {@param listener} after this
 call. However, the {@param IBackupTransport} parameter, the transport binder, is not
 guaranteed to be non-null, or if it's non-null it's not guaranteed to be usable - i.e. it can
 throw {@link DeadObjectException}s on method calls. You should check for both in your code.
 The reasons for a null transport binder are:

 &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Some code called {@link #unbind}(String) before you got a callback.
   &lt;li&gt;The framework had already called {@link ServiceConnection#onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName)} or {@link ServiceConnection#onBindingDied(ComponentName)} on this object's connection before.
       Check the documentation of those methods for when that happens.
   &lt;li&gt;The framework returns false for {@link Context#bindServiceAsUser(Intent,
       ServiceConnection, int, UserHandle)} (or one of its variants). Check documentation for
       when this happens.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 For unusable transport binders check {@link DeadObjectException}.
@param {Object {TransportConnectionListener}} listener The listener that will be called with the (possibly null or unusable) {@link
     IBackupTransport} instance and this {@link TransportClient} object.
@param {String} caller A {@link String} identifying the caller for logging/debugging purposes. This
     should be a human-readable short string that is easily identifiable in the logs. Ideally
     TAG.methodName(), where TAG is the one used in logcat. In cases where this is is not very
     descriptive like MyHandler.handleMessage() you should put something that someone reading
     the code would understand, like MyHandler/MSG_FOO.

 &lt;p&gt;Synchronous version of {@link #connectAsync(TransportConnectionListener, String)}. The
 same observations about state are valid here. Also, what was said about the {@link IBackupTransport} parameter of {@link com.android.server.backup.transport.TransportConnectionListener} now apply to the return
 value of this method.

 &lt;p&gt;This is a potentially blocking operation, so be sure to call this carefully on the correct
 threads. You can't call this from the process main-thread (it throws an exception if you do
 so).

 &lt;p&gt;In most cases only the first call to this method will block, the following calls should
 return instantly. However, this is not guaranteed.
