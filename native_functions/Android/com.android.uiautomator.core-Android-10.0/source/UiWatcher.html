</span> find a match using the {@link com.android.uiautomator.core.UiSelector}

 When the framework is in the process of matching a {@link com.android.uiautomator.core.UiSelector} and it
 is unable to match any widget based on the specified criteria in the selector,
 the framework will perform retries for a predetermined time, waiting for the display
 to update and show the desired widget. While the framework is in this state, it will call
 registered watchers' checkForCondition(). This gives the registered watchers a chance
 to take a look at the display and see if there is a recognized condition that can be
 handled and in doing so allowing the current test to continue.

 An example usage would be to look for dialogs popped due to other background
 processes requesting user attention and have nothing to do with the application
 currently under test.
