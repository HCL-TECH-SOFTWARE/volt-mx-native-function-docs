</span> A token representing the registration of a {@link java.nio.file.Watchable watchable} object
 with a {@link java.nio.file.WatchService}.

 &lt;p&gt; A watch key is created when a watchable object is registered with a watch
 service. The key remains {@link #isValid valid} until:
 &lt;ol&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; It is cancelled, explicitly, by invoking its {@link #cancel cancel}
     method, or&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Cancelled implicitly, because the object is no longer accessible,
     or &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; By {@link java.nio.file.WatchService#close closing} the watch service. &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; A watch key has a state. When initially created the key is said to be
 &lt;em&gt;ready&lt;/em&gt;. When an event is detected then the key is &lt;em&gt;signalled&lt;/em&gt;
 and queued so that it can be retrieved by invoking the watch service's {@link java.nio.file.WatchService#poll() poll} or {@link java.nio.file.WatchService#take() take} methods. Once
 signalled, a key remains in this state until its {@link #reset reset} method
 is invoked to return the key to the ready state. Events detected while the
 key is in the signalled state are queued but do not cause the key to be
 re-queued for retrieval from the watch service. Events are retrieved by
 invoking the key's {@link #pollEvents pollEvents} method. This method
 retrieves and removes all events accumulated for the object. When initially
 created, a watch key has no pending events. Typically events are retrieved
 when the key is in the signalled state leading to the following idiom:

 &lt;pre&gt;
     for (;;) {
         // retrieve key
         WatchKey key = watcher.take();

         // process events
         for (WatchEvent&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; event: key.pollEvents()) {
             :
         }

         // reset the key
         boolean valid = key.reset();
         if (!valid) {
             // object no longer registered
         }
     }
 &lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; Watch keys are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. Where there
 are several threads retrieving signalled keys from a watch service then care
 should be taken to ensure that the {@code reset} method is only invoked after
 the events for the object have been processed. This ensures that one thread
 is processing the events for an object at any time.

 &lt;p&gt; As the {@code WatchService} is intended to map directly on to the
 native file event notification facility (where available) then many of
 details on how registered objects are watched is highly implementation
 specific. When watching a directory for changes for example, and the
 directory is moved or renamed in the file system, there is no guarantee
 that the watch key will be cancelled and so the object returned by this
 method may no longer be a valid path to the directory.
