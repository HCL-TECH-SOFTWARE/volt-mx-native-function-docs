</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 The Camera class is used to set image capture settings, start/stop preview,
 snap pictures, and retrieve frames for encoding for video.  This class is a
 client for the Camera service, which manages the actual camera hardware.

 &lt;p&gt;To access the device camera, you must declare the
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#CAMERA} permission in your Android
 Manifest. Also be sure to include the
 &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element.html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;uses-feature&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 manifest element to declare camera features used by your application.
 For example, if you use the camera and auto-focus feature, your Manifest
 should include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;pre&gt; &amp;lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.CAMERA&quot; /&gt;
 &amp;lt;uses-feature android:name=&quot;android.hardware.camera&quot; /&gt;
 &amp;lt;uses-feature android:name=&quot;android.hardware.camera.autofocus&quot; /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To take pictures with this class, use the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Obtain an instance of Camera from {@link #open}(int).

 &lt;li&gt;Get existing (default) settings with {@link #getParameters}().

 &lt;li&gt;If necessary, modify the returned {@link android.hardware.Camera.Parameters} object and call
 {@link #setParameters(Camera.Parameters)}.

 &lt;li&gt;Call {@link #setDisplayOrientation}(int) to ensure correct orientation of preview.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important&lt;/b&gt;: Pass a fully initialized {@link SurfaceHolder} to
 {@link #setPreviewDisplay}(SurfaceHolder).  Without a surface, the camera
 will be unable to start the preview.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important&lt;/b&gt;: Call {@link #startPreview}() to start updating the
 preview surface.  Preview must be started before you can take a picture.

 &lt;li&gt;When you want, call {@link #takePicture(android.hardware.Camera.ShutterCallback,
 android.hardware.Camera.PictureCallback, android.hardware.Camera.PictureCallback, android.hardware.Camera.PictureCallback)} to
 capture a photo.  Wait for the callbacks to provide the actual image data.

 &lt;li&gt;After taking a picture, preview display will have stopped.  To take more
 photos, call {@link #startPreview}() again first.

 &lt;li&gt;Call {@link #stopPreview}() to stop updating the preview surface.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; Call {@link #release}() to release the camera for
 use by other applications.  Applications should release the camera
 immediately in {@link android.app.Activity#onPause()} (and re-{@link #open}()
 it in {@link android.app.Activity#onResume()}).
 &lt;/ol&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To quickly switch to video recording mode, use these steps:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Obtain and initialize a Camera and start preview as described above.

 &lt;li&gt;Call {@link #unlock}() to allow the media process to access the camera.

 &lt;li&gt;Pass the camera to {@link android.media.MediaRecorder#setCamera(Camera)}.
 See {@link android.media.MediaRecorder} information about video recording.

 &lt;li&gt;When finished recording, call {@link #reconnect}() to re-acquire
 and re-lock the camera.

 &lt;li&gt;If desired, restart preview and take more photos or videos.

 &lt;li&gt;Call {@link #stopPreview}() and {@link #release}() as described above.
 &lt;/ol&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This class is not thread-safe, and is meant for use from one event thread.
 Most long-running operations (preview, focus, photo capture, etc) happen
 asynchronously and invoke callbacks as necessary.  Callbacks will be invoked
 on the event thread {@link #open}(int) was called from.  This class's methods
 must never be called from multiple threads at once.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class=&quot;caution&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caution:&lt;/strong&gt; Different Android-powered devices
 may have different hardware specifications, such as megapixel ratings and
 auto-focus capabilities. In order for your application to be compatible with
 more devices, you should not make assumptions about the device camera
 specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
