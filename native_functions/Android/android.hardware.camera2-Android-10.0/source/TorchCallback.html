</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 A callback for camera flash torch modes becoming unavailable, disabled, or enabled.

 &lt;p&gt;The torch mode becomes unavailable when the camera device it belongs to becomes
 unavailable or other camera resources it needs become busy due to other higher priority
 camera activities. The torch mode becomes disabled when it was turned off or when the camera
 device it belongs to is no longer in use and other camera resources it needs are no longer
 busy. A camera's torch mode is turned off when an application calls {@link #setTorchMode} to
 turn off the camera's torch mode, or when an application turns on another camera's torch mode
 if keeping multiple torch modes on simultaneously is not supported. The torch mode becomes
 enabled when it is turned on via {@link #setTorchMode}.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The torch mode is available to set via {@link #setTorchMode} only when it's in a disabled
 or enabled state.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Extend this callback and pass an instance of the subclass to
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraManager#registerTorchCallback} to be notified of such status changes.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 turned off before {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraManager.TorchCallback#onTorchModeUnavailable} is
 invoked. {@link #setTorchMode} will fail until the torch mode has entered a disabled or
 enabled state again.&lt;/p&gt;
