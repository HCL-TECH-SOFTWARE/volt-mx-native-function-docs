</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Delegates per-thread CPU collection to {@link com.android.internal.os.KernelCpuThreadReader}, and calculates the
 difference between CPU usage at each call of {@link #getProcessCpuUsageDiffed}().

 &lt;p&gt;Some notes on the diff calculation:

 &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;The diffing is done between each call of {@link #getProcessCpuUsageDiffed}(), i.e. call N
       of this method will return CPU used by threads between call N-1 and N.
   &lt;li&gt;The first call of {@link #getProcessCpuUsageDiffed}() will return no processes (&quot;first
       call&quot; is the first call in the lifetime of a {@link com.android.internal.os.KernelCpuThreadReaderDiff} object).
   &lt;li&gt;If a thread does not exist at call N, but does exist at call N+1, the diff will assume that
       the CPU usage at call N was zero. Thus, the diff reported will be equivalent to the value
       returned by {@link com.android.internal.os.KernelCpuThreadReader#getProcessCpuUsage()} at call N+1.
   &lt;li&gt;If an error occurs in {@link com.android.internal.os.KernelCpuThreadReader} at call N, we will return no
       information for CPU usage between call N-1 and N (as we don't know the start value) and
       between N and N+1 (as we don't know the end value). Assuming all other calls are
       successful, the next call to return data will be N+2, for the period between N+1 and N+2.
   &lt;li&gt;If an error occurs in this class (but not in {@link com.android.internal.os.KernelCpuThreadReader}) at call N, the
       data will only be dropped for call N, as we can still use the CPU data for the surrounding
       calls.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Additionally to diffing, this class also contains logic for thresholding reported threads. A
 thread will not be reported unless its total CPU usage is at least equal to the value set in
 {@link #setMinimumTotalCpuUsageMillis}. Filtered thread CPU usage is summed and reported under
 one &quot;other threads&quot; thread. This reduces the cardinality of the {@link #getProcessCpuUsageDiffed}() result.

 &lt;p&gt;Thresholding is done in this class, instead of {@link com.android.internal.os.KernelCpuThreadReader}, and instead of
 WestWorld, because the thresholding should be done after diffing, not before. This is because of
 two issues with thresholding before diffing:

 &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;We would threshold less and less threads as thread uptime increases.
   &lt;li&gt;We would encounter errors as the filtered threads become unfiltered, as the &quot;other threads&quot;
       result could have negative diffs, and the newly unfiltered threads would have incorrect
       diffs that include CPU usage from when they were filtered.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
