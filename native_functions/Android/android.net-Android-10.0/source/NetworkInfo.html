</span> implements android.os.Parcelable

@extends java.lang.Object

 Describes the status of a network interface.
 &lt;p&gt;Use {@link android.net.ConnectivityManager#getActiveNetworkInfo()} to get an instance that represents
 the current network connection.

 @deprecated Callers should instead use the {@link android.net.ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback} API to
             learn about connectivity changes, or switch to use
             {@link android.net.ConnectivityManager#getNetworkCapabilities} or
             {@link android.net.ConnectivityManager#getLinkProperties} to get information synchronously. Keep
             in mind that while callbacks are guaranteed to be called for every event in order,
             synchronous calls have no such constraints, and as such it is unadvisable to use the
             synchronous methods inside the callbacks as they will often not offer a view of
             networking that is consistent (that is: they may return a past or a future state with
             respect to the event being processed by the callback). Instead, callers are advised
             to only use the arguments of the callbacks, possibly memorizing the specific bits of
             information they need to keep from one callback to another.
