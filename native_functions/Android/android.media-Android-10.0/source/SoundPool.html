 The SoundPool class manages and plays audio resources for applications.

 &lt;p&gt;A SoundPool is a collection of samples that can be loaded into memory
 from a resource inside the APK or from a file in the file system. The
 SoundPool library uses the MediaPlayer service to decode the audio
 into a raw 16-bit PCM mono or stereo stream. This allows applications
 to ship with compressed streams without having to suffer the CPU load
 and latency of decompressing during playback.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In addition to low-latency playback, SoundPool can also manage the number
 of audio streams being rendered at once. When the SoundPool object is
 constructed, the maxStreams parameter sets the maximum number of streams
 that can be played at a time from this single SoundPool. SoundPool tracks
 the number of active streams. If the maximum number of streams is exceeded,
 SoundPool will automatically stop a previously playing stream based first
 on priority and then by age within that priority. Limiting the maximum
 number of streams helps to cap CPU loading and reducing the likelihood that
 audio mixing will impact visuals or UI performance.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Sounds can be looped by setting a non-zero loop value. A value of -1
 causes the sound to loop forever. In this case, the application must
 explicitly call the stop() function to stop the sound. Any other non-zero
 value will cause the sound to repeat the specified number of times, e.g.
 a value of 3 causes the sound to play a total of 4 times.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The playback rate can also be changed. A playback rate of 1.0 causes
 the sound to play at its original frequency (resampled, if necessary,
 to the hardware output frequency). A playback rate of 2.0 causes the
 sound to play at twice its original frequency, and a playback rate of
 0.5 causes it to play at half its original frequency. The playback
 rate range is 0.5 to 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Priority runs low to high, i.e. higher numbers are higher priority.
 Priority is used when a call to play() would cause the number of active
 streams to exceed the value established by the maxStreams parameter when
 the SoundPool was created. In this case, the stream allocator will stop
 the lowest priority stream. If there are multiple streams with the same
 low priority, it will choose the oldest stream to stop. In the case
 where the priority of the new stream is lower than all the active
 streams, the new sound will not play and the play() function will return
 a streamID of zero.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Let's examine a typical use case: A game consists of several levels of
 play. For each level, there is a set of unique sounds that are used only
 by that level. In this case, the game logic should create a new SoundPool
 object when the first level is loaded. The level data itself might contain
 the list of sounds to be used by this level. The loading logic iterates
 through the list of sounds calling the appropriate SoundPool.load()
 function. This should typically be done early in the process to allow time
 for decompressing the audio to raw PCM format before they are needed for
 playback.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Once the sounds are loaded and play has started, the application can
 trigger sounds by calling SoundPool.play(). Playing streams can be
 paused or resumed, and the application can also alter the pitch by
 adjusting the playback rate in real-time for doppler or synthesis
 effects.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Note that since streams can be stopped due to resource constraints, the
 streamID is a reference to a particular instance of a stream. If the stream
 is stopped to allow a higher priority stream to play, the stream is no
 longer valid. However, the application is allowed to call methods on
 the streamID without error. This may help simplify program logic since
 the application need not concern itself with the stream lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In our example, when the player has completed the level, the game
 logic should call SoundPool.release() to release all the native resources
 in use and then set the SoundPool reference to null. If the player starts
 another level, a new SoundPool is created, sounds are loaded, and play
 resumes.&lt;/p&gt;
