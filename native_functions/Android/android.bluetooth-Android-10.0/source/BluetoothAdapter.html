</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Represents the local device Bluetooth adapter. The {@link android.bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter}
 lets you perform fundamental Bluetooth tasks, such as initiate
 device discovery, query a list of bonded (paired) devices,
 instantiate a {@link android.bluetooth.BluetoothDevice} using a known MAC address, and create
 a {@link android.bluetooth.BluetoothServerSocket} to listen for connection requests from other
 devices, and start a scan for Bluetooth LE devices.

 &lt;p&gt;To get a {@link android.bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter} representing the local Bluetooth
 adapter, call the {@link android.bluetooth.BluetoothManager#getAdapter} function on {@link android.bluetooth.BluetoothManager}.
 On JELLY_BEAN_MR1 and below you will need to use the static {@link #getDefaultAdapter}
 method instead.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 Fundamentally, this is your starting point for all
 Bluetooth actions. Once you have the local adapter, you can get a set of
 {@link android.bluetooth.BluetoothDevice} objects representing all paired devices with
 {@link #getBondedDevices}(); start device discovery with
 {@link #startDiscovery}(); or create a {@link android.bluetooth.BluetoothServerSocket} to
 listen for incoming RFComm connection requests with {@link #listenUsingRfcommWithServiceRecord(String, UUID)}; listen for incoming L2CAP Connection-oriented
 Channels (CoC) connection requests with {@link #listenUsingL2capChannel()}; or start a scan for
 Bluetooth LE devices with {@link #startLeScan}(LeScanCallback callback).
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This class is thread safe.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Most methods require the {@link android.Manifest.permission#BLUETOOTH}
 permission and some also require the
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#BLUETOOTH_ADMIN} permission.
 &lt;/p&gt;
