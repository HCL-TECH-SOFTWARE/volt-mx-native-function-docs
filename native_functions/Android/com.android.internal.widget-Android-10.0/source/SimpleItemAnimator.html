 A wrapper class for ItemAnimator that records View bounds and decides whether it should run
 move, change, add or remove animations. This class also replicates the original ItemAnimator
 API.

 It uses {@link com.android.internal.widget.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo} to track the bounds information of the Views. If you would like
 to
 extend this class, you can override {@link #obtainHolderInfo}() method to provide your own info
 class that extends {@link com.android.internal.widget.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo}.
