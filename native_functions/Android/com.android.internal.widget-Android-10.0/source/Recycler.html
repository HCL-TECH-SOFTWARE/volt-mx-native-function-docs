 A Recycler is responsible for managing scrapped or detached item views for reuse.

 &lt;p&gt;A &quot;scrapped&quot; view is a view that is still attached to its parent RecyclerView but
 that has been marked for removal or reuse.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Typical use of a Recycler by a {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.LayoutManager} will be to obtain views for
 an adapter's data set representing the data at a given position or item ID.
 If the view to be reused is considered &quot;dirty&quot; the adapter will be asked to rebind it.
 If not, the view can be quickly reused by the LayoutManager with no further work.
 Clean views that have not {@link android.view.View#isLayoutRequested() requested layout}
 may be repositioned by a LayoutManager without remeasurement.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 Generally, a LayoutManager should acquire its views via {@link #getViewForPosition}(int)
 and let the RecyclerView handle caching. This is a helper method for LayoutManager who
 wants to handle its own recycling logic.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Note that, {@link #getViewForPosition}(int) already binds the View to the position so
 you don't need to call this method unless you want to bind this View to another position.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Usually, LayoutManager does not need to worry about this. However, in some cases, your
 LayoutManager may need to call some custom component with item positions in which
 case you need the actual adapter position instead of the pre layout position. You
 can use this method to convert a pre-layout position to adapter (post layout) position.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Note that if the provided position belongs to a deleted ViewHolder, this method will
 return -1.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Calling this method in post-layout state returns the same value back.
@param {Number} position The pre-layout position to convert. Must be greater or equal to 0 and

 a scrap view that was previously initialized for that data without rebinding.
