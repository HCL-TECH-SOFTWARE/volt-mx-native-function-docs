 &lt;p&gt;Contains useful information about the current RecyclerView state like target scroll
 position or view focus. State object can also keep arbitrary data, identified by resource
 ids.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Often times, RecyclerView components will need to pass information between each other.
 To provide a well defined data bus between components, RecyclerView passes the same State
 object to component callbacks and these components can use it to exchange data.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;If you implement custom components, you can use State's put/get/remove methods to pass
 data between your components without needing to manage their lifecycles.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 RecyclerView listens for Adapter's notify events and calculates the effects of adapter
 data changes on existing Views. These calculations are used to decide which animations
 should be run.
 &lt;p&gt;
 To support predictive animations, RecyclerView may rewrite or reorder Adapter changes to
 present the correct state to LayoutManager in pre-layout pass.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For example, a newly added item is not included in pre-layout item count because
 pre-layout reflects the contents of the adapter before the item is added. Behind the
 scenes, RecyclerView offsets {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.Recycler#getViewForPosition(int)} calls such that
 LayoutManager does not know about the new item's existence in pre-layout. The item will
 be available in second layout pass and will be included in the item count. Similar
 adjustments are made for moved and removed items as well.
 &lt;p&gt;
 You can get the adapter's item count via {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.LayoutManager#getItemCount()} method.
