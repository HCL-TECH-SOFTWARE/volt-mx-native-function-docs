 Signals that one of the ObjectStreamExceptions was thrown during a
 write operation.  Thrown during a read operation when one of the
 ObjectStreamExceptions was thrown during a write operation.  The
 exception that terminated the write can be found in the detail
 field. The stream is reset to it's initial state and all references
 to objects already deserialized are discarded.

 &lt;p&gt;As of release 1.4, this exception has been retrofitted to conform to
 the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism.  The &quot;exception causing
 the abort&quot; that is provided at construction time and
 accessed via the public {@link #detail} field is now known as the
 &lt;i&gt;cause&lt;/i&gt;, and may be accessed via the {@link Throwable#getCause()}
 method, as well as the aforementioned &quot;legacy field.&quot;
