 Signals that an I/O operation has been interrupted. An
 &lt;code&gt;InterruptedIOException&lt;/code&gt; is thrown to indicate that an
 input or output transfer has been terminated because the thread
 performing it was interrupted. The field {@link #bytesTransferred}
 indicates how many bytes were successfully transferred before
 the interruption occurred.
