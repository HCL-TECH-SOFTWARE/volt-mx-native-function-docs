</span> implements java.io.DataInput

@extends java.io.FilterInputStream

 A data input stream lets an application read primitive Java data
 types from an underlying input stream in a machine-independent
 way. An application uses a data output stream to write data that
 can later be read by a data input stream.
 &lt;p&gt;
 DataInputStream is not necessarily safe for multithreaded access.
 Thread safety is optional and is the responsibility of users of
 methods in this class.

 until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an
 exception is thrown.

 &lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is null, a &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt; is
 thrown. If the length of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is zero, then no bytes are
 read and &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt
 to read at least one byte. If no byte is available because the
 stream is at end of file, the value &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; is returned;
 otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;.

 &lt;p&gt;The first byte read is stored into element &lt;code&gt;b[0]&lt;/code&gt;, the

 unaffected.
