</span>@extends java.io.Reader

 Reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to
 provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.

 &lt;p&gt; The buffer size may be specified, or the default size may be used.  The
 default is large enough for most purposes.

 &lt;p&gt; In general, each read request made of a Reader causes a corresponding
 read request to be made of the underlying character or byte stream.  It is
 therefore advisable to wrap a BufferedReader around any Reader whose read()
 operations may be costly, such as FileReaders and InputStreamReaders.  For
 example,

 &lt;pre&gt;
 BufferedReader in
   = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(&quot;foo.in&quot;));
 &lt;/pre&gt;

 will buffer the input from the specified file.  Without buffering, each
 invocation of read() or readLine() could cause bytes to be read from the
 file, converted into characters, and then returned, which can be very
 inefficient.

 &lt;p&gt; Programs that use DataInputStreams for textual input can be localized by
 replacing each DataInputStream with an appropriate BufferedReader.

 &lt;p&gt; This method implements the general contract of the corresponding
 &lt;code&gt;{@link java.io.Reader#read(char[], int, int) read}&lt;/code&gt; method of the
 &lt;code&gt;{@link java.io.Reader}&lt;/code&gt; class.  As an additional convenience, it
 attempts to read as many characters as possible by repeatedly invoking
 the &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; method of the underlying stream.  This iterated
 &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; continues until one of the following conditions becomes
 true: &lt;ul&gt;

   &lt;li&gt; The specified number of characters have been read,

   &lt;li&gt; The &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; method of the underlying stream returns
   &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;, indicating end-of-file, or

   &lt;li&gt; The &lt;code&gt;ready&lt;/code&gt; method of the underlying stream
   returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, indicating that further input requests
   would block.

 &lt;/ul&gt; If the first &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; on the underlying stream returns
 &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; to indicate end-of-file then this method returns
 &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;.  Otherwise this method returns the number of characters
 actually read.

 &lt;p&gt; Subclasses of this class are encouraged, but not required, to
 attempt to read as many characters as possible in the same fashion.

 &lt;p&gt; Ordinarily this method takes characters from this stream's character
 buffer, filling it from the underlying stream as necessary.  If,
 however, the buffer is empty, the mark is not valid, and the requested
 length is at least as large as the buffer, then this method will read
 characters directly from the underlying stream into the given array.
 Thus redundant &lt;code&gt;BufferedReader&lt;/code&gt;s will not copy data
 unnecessarily.
