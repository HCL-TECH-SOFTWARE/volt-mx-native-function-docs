</span>@extends java.io.FilterInputStream

 This class is an input stream filter that provides the added
 functionality of keeping track of the current line number.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A line is a sequence of bytes ending with a carriage return
 character ({@code '\r'}), a newline character
 ({@code '\n'}), or a carriage return character followed
 immediately by a linefeed character. In all three cases, the line
 terminating character(s) are returned as a single newline character.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The line number begins at {@code 0}, and is incremented by
 {@code 1} when a {@code read} returns a newline character.

 @author     Arthur van Hoff
 @see        java.io.LineNumberReader
 @since      JDK1.0
 @deprecated This class incorrectly assumes that bytes adequately represent
             characters.  As of JDK&amp;nbsp;1.1, the preferred way to operate on
             character streams is via the new character-stream classes, which
             include a class for counting line numbers.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Stream marks are intended to be used in
 situations where you need to read ahead a little to see what's in
 the stream. Often this is most easily done by invoking some
 general parser. If the stream is of the type handled by the
 parser, it just chugs along happily. If the stream is not of
 that type, the parser should toss an exception when it fails,
 which, if it happens within readlimit bytes, allows the outer
 code to reset the stream and try another parser.
