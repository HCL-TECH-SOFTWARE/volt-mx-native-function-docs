</span>@extends android.transition.PathMotion

 A PathMotion that generates a curved path along an arc on an imaginary circle containing
 the two points. If the horizontal distance between the points is less than the vertical
 distance, then the circle's center point will be horizontally aligned with the end point. If the
 vertical distance is less than the horizontal distance then the circle's center point
 will be vertically aligned with the end point.
 &lt;p&gt;
 When the two points are near horizontal or vertical, the curve of the motion will be
 small as the center of the circle will be far from both points. To force curvature of
 the path, {@link #setMinimumHorizontalAngle}(float) and
 {@link #setMinimumVerticalAngle}(float) may be used to set the minimum angle of the
 arc between two points.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This may be used in XML as an element inside a transition.&lt;/p&gt;
