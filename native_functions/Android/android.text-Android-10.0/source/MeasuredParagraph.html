</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 MeasuredParagraph provides text information for rendering purpose.

 The first motivation of this class is identify the text directions and retrieving individual
 character widths. However retrieving character widths is slower than identifying text directions.
 Thus, this class provides several builder methods for specific purposes.

 - buildForBidi:
   Compute only text directions.
 - buildForMeasurement:
   Compute text direction and all character widths.
 - buildForStaticLayout:
   This is bit special. StaticLayout also needs to know text direction and character widths for
   line breaking, but all things are done in native code. Similarly, text measurement is done
   in native code. So instead of storing result to Java array, this keeps the result in native
   code since there is no good reason to move the results to Java layer.

 In addition to the character widths, some additional information is computed for each purposes,
 e.g. whole text length for measurement or font metrics for static layout.

 MeasuredParagraph is NOT a thread safe object.
