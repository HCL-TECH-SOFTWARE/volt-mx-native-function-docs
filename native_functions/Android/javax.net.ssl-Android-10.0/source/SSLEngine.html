</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 A class which enables secure communications using protocols such as
 the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or
 &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt&quot;&gt; IETF RFC 2246 &quot;Transport
 Layer Security&quot; (TLS) &lt;/A&gt; protocols, but is transport independent.
 &lt;P&gt;
 The secure communications modes include: &lt;UL&gt;

      &lt;LI&gt; &lt;em&gt;Integrity Protection&lt;/em&gt;.  SSL/TLS protects against
      modification of messages by an active wiretapper.

      &lt;LI&gt; &lt;em&gt;Authentication&lt;/em&gt;.  In most modes, SSL/TLS provides
      peer authentication.  Servers are usually authenticated, and
      clients may be authenticated as requested by servers.

      &lt;LI&gt; &lt;em&gt;Confidentiality (Privacy Protection)&lt;/em&gt;.  In most
      modes, SSL/TLS encrypts data being sent between client and
      server.  This protects the confidentiality of data, so that
      passive wiretappers won't see sensitive data such as financial
      information or personal information of many kinds.

      &lt;/UL&gt;

 These kinds of protection are specified by a &quot;cipher suite&quot;, which
 is a combination of cryptographic algorithms used by a given SSL
 connection.  During the negotiation process, the two endpoints must
 agree on a cipher suite that is available in both environments.  If
 there is no such suite in common, no SSL connection can be
 established, and no data can be exchanged.
 &lt;P&gt;
 The cipher suite used is established by a negotiation process called
 &quot;handshaking&quot;.  The goal of this process is to create or rejoin a
 &quot;session&quot;, which may protect many connections over time.  After
 handshaking has completed, you can access session attributes by
 using the {@link #getSession}() method.
 &lt;P&gt;
 The &lt;code&gt;SSLSocket&lt;/code&gt; class provides much of the same security
 functionality, but all of the inbound and outbound data is
 automatically transported using the underlying {@link java.net.Socket Socket}, which by design uses a blocking model.
 While this is appropriate for many applications, this model does not
 provide the scalability required by large servers.
 &lt;P&gt;
 The primary distinction of an &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt; is that it
 operates on inbound and outbound byte streams, independent of the
 transport mechanism.  It is the responsibility of the
 &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt; user to arrange for reliable I/O transport to
 the peer.  By separating the SSL/TLS abstraction from the I/O
 transport mechanism, the &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt; can be used for a
 wide variety of I/O types, such as {@link java.nio.channels.spi.AbstractSelectableChannel#configureBlocking(boolean)
 non-blocking I/O (polling)}, {@link java.nio.channels.Selector
 selectable non-blocking I/O}, {@link java.net.Socket Socket} and the
 traditional Input/OutputStreams, local {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer
 ByteBuffers} or byte arrays, &lt;A
 HREF=&quot;http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=203&quot;&gt; future asynchronous
 I/O models &lt;/A&gt;, and so on.
 &lt;P&gt;
 At a high level, the &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt; appears thus:

 &lt;pre&gt;
                   app data

                |           ^
                |     |     |
                v     |     |
           +----+-----|-----+----+
           |          |          |
           |       SSL|Engine    |
   wrap()  |          |          |  unwrap()
           | OUTBOUND | INBOUND  |
           |          |          |
           +----+-----|-----+----+
                |     |     ^
                |     |     |
                v           |

                   net data
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 Application data (also known as plaintext or cleartext) is data which
 is produced or consumed by an application.  Its counterpart is
 network data, which consists of either handshaking and/or ciphertext
 (encrypted) data, and destined to be transported via an I/O
 mechanism.  Inbound data is data which has been received from the
 peer, and outbound data is destined for the peer.
 &lt;P&gt;
 (In the context of an &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt;, the term &quot;handshake
 data&quot; is taken to mean any data exchanged to establish and control a
 secure connection.  Handshake data includes the SSL/TLS messages
 &quot;alert&quot;, &quot;change_cipher_spec,&quot; and &quot;handshake.&quot;)
 &lt;P&gt;
 There are five distinct phases to an &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt;.

 &lt;OL&gt;
     &lt;li&gt; Creation - The &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt; has been created and
     initialized, but has not yet been used.  During this phase, an
     application may set any &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt;-specific settings
     (enabled cipher suites, whether the &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt; should
     handshake in client or server mode, and so on).  Once
     handshaking has begun, though, any new settings (except
     client/server mode, see below) will be used for
     the next handshake.

     &lt;li&gt; Initial Handshake - The initial handshake is a procedure by
     which the two peers exchange communication parameters until an
     SSLSession is established.  Application data can not be sent during
     this phase.

     &lt;li&gt; Application Data - Once the communication parameters have
     been established and the handshake is complete, application data
     may flow through the &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt;.  Outbound
     application messages are encrypted and integrity protected,
     and inbound messages reverse the process.

     &lt;li&gt;  Rehandshaking - Either side may request a renegotiation of
     the session at any time during the Application Data phase.  New
     handshaking data can be intermixed among the application data.
     Before starting the rehandshake phase, the application may
     reset the SSL/TLS communication parameters such as the list of
     enabled ciphersuites and whether to use client authentication,
     but can not change between client/server modes.  As before, once
     handshaking has begun, any new &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt;
     configuration settings will not be used until the next
     handshake.

     &lt;li&gt;  Closure - When the connection is no longer needed, the
     application should close the &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt; and should
     send/receive any remaining messages to the peer before
     closing the underlying transport mechanism.  Once an engine is
     closed, it is not reusable:  a new &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt; must
     be created.
 &lt;/OL&gt;
 An &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt; is created by calling {@link javax.net.ssl.SSLContext#createSSLEngine()} from an initialized
 &lt;code&gt;SSLContext&lt;/code&gt;.  Any configuration
 parameters should be set before making the first call to
 &lt;code&gt;wrap()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unwrap()&lt;/code&gt;, or
 &lt;code&gt;beginHandshake()&lt;/code&gt;.  These methods all trigger the
 initial handshake.
 &lt;P&gt;
 Data moves through the engine by calling {@link #wrap(ByteBuffer,
 ByteBuffer) wrap()} or {@link #unwrap(ByteBuffer, ByteBuffer)
 unwrap()} on outbound or inbound data, respectively.  Depending on
 the state of the &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;wrap()&lt;/code&gt; call
 may consume application data from the source buffer and may produce
 network data in the destination buffer.  The outbound data
 may contain application and/or handshake data.  A call to
 &lt;code&gt;unwrap()&lt;/code&gt; will examine the source buffer and may
 advance the handshake if the data is handshaking information, or
 may place application data in the destination buffer if the data
 is application.  The state of the underlying SSL/TLS algorithm
 will determine when data is consumed and produced.
 &lt;P&gt;
 Calls to &lt;code&gt;wrap()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unwrap()&lt;/code&gt; return an
 &lt;code&gt;SSLEngineResult&lt;/code&gt; which indicates the status of the
 operation, and (optionally) how to interact with the engine to make
 progress.
 &lt;P&gt;
 The &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt; produces/consumes complete SSL/TLS
 packets only, and does not store application data internally between
 calls to &lt;code&gt;wrap()/unwrap()&lt;/code&gt;.  Thus input and output
 &lt;code&gt;ByteBuffer&lt;/code&gt;s must be sized appropriately to hold the
 maximum record that can be produced.  Calls to {@link javax.net.ssl.SSLSession#getPacketBufferSize()} and {@link javax.net.ssl.SSLSession#getApplicationBufferSize()} should be used to determine
 the appropriate buffer sizes.  The size of the outbound application
 data buffer generally does not matter.  If buffer conditions do not
 allow for the proper consumption/production of data, the application
 must determine (via {@link javax.net.ssl.SSLEngineResult}) and correct the
 problem, and then try the call again.
 &lt;P&gt;
 For example, &lt;code&gt;unwrap()&lt;/code&gt; will return a {@link javax.net.ssl.SSLEngineResult.Status#BUFFER_OVERFLOW} result if the engine
 determines that there is not enough destination buffer space available.
 Applications should call {@link javax.net.ssl.SSLSession#getApplicationBufferSize()}
 and compare that value with the space available in the destination buffer,
 enlarging the buffer if necessary.  Similarly, if &lt;code&gt;unwrap()&lt;/code&gt;
 were to return a {@link javax.net.ssl.SSLEngineResult.Status#BUFFER_UNDERFLOW}, the
 application should call {@link javax.net.ssl.SSLSession#getPacketBufferSize()} to ensure
 that the source buffer has enough room to hold a record (enlarging if
 necessary), and then obtain more inbound data.

 &lt;pre&gt;{@code
   SSLEngineResult r = engine.unwrap(src, dst);
   switch (r.getStatus()) {
   BUFFER_OVERFLOW:
       // Could attempt to drain the dst buffer of any already obtained
       // data, but we'll just increase it to the size needed.
       int appSize = engine.getSession().getApplicationBufferSize();
       ByteBuffer b = ByteBuffer.allocate(appSize + dst.position());
       dst.flip();
       b.put(dst);
       dst = b;
       // retry the operation.
       break;
   BUFFER_UNDERFLOW:
       int netSize = engine.getSession().getPacketBufferSize();
       // Resize buffer if needed.
       if (netSize &gt; dst.capacity()) {
           ByteBuffer b = ByteBuffer.allocate(netSize);
           src.flip();
           b.put(src);
           src = b;
       }
       // Obtain more inbound network data for src,
       // then retry the operation.
       break;
   // other cases: CLOSED, OK.
   }
 }&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;P&gt;
 Unlike &lt;code&gt;SSLSocket&lt;/code&gt;, all methods of SSLEngine are
 non-blocking.  &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt; implementations may
 require the results of tasks that may take an extended period of
 time to complete, or may even block.  For example, a TrustManager
 may need to connect to a remote certificate validation service,
 or a KeyManager might need to prompt a user to determine which
 certificate to use as part of client authentication.  Additionally,
 creating cryptographic signatures and verifying them can be slow,
 seemingly blocking.
 &lt;P&gt;
 For any operation which may potentially block, the
 &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt; will create a {@link java.lang.Runnable}
 delegated task.  When &lt;code&gt;SSLEngineResult&lt;/code&gt; indicates that a
 delegated task result is needed, the application must call {@link #getDelegatedTask}() to obtain an outstanding delegated task and
 call its {@link java.lang.Runnable#run() run()} method (possibly using
 a different thread depending on the compute strategy).  The
 application should continue obtaining delegated tasks until no more
 exist, and try the original operation again.
 &lt;P&gt;
 At the end of a communication session, applications should properly
 close the SSL/TLS link.  The SSL/TLS protocols have closure handshake
 messages, and these messages should be communicated to the peer
 before releasing the &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt; and closing the
 underlying transport mechanism.  A close can be initiated by one of:
 an SSLException, an inbound closure handshake message, or one of the
 close methods.  In all cases, closure handshake messages are
 generated by the engine, and &lt;code&gt;wrap()&lt;/code&gt; should be repeatedly
 called until the resulting &lt;code&gt;SSLEngineResult&lt;/code&gt;'s status
 returns &quot;CLOSED&quot;, or {@link #isOutboundDone}() returns true.  All
 data obtained from the &lt;code&gt;wrap()&lt;/code&gt; method should be sent to the
 peer.
 &lt;P&gt;
 {@link #closeOutbound}() is used to signal the engine that the
 application will not be sending any more data.
 &lt;P&gt;
 A peer will signal its intent to close by sending its own closure
 handshake message.  After this message has been received and
 processed by the local &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;unwrap()&lt;/code&gt;
 call, the application can detect the close by calling
 &lt;code&gt;unwrap()&lt;/code&gt; and looking for a &lt;code&gt;SSLEngineResult&lt;/code&gt;
 with status &quot;CLOSED&quot;, or if {@link #isInboundDone}() returns true.
 If for some reason the peer closes the communication link without
 sending the proper SSL/TLS closure message, the application can
 detect the end-of-stream and can signal the engine via {@link #closeInbound}() that there will no more inbound messages to
 process.  Some applications might choose to require orderly shutdown
 messages from a peer, in which case they can check that the closure
 was generated by a handshake message and not by an end-of-stream
 condition.
 &lt;P&gt;
 There are two groups of cipher suites which you will need to know
 about when managing cipher suites:

 &lt;UL&gt;
      &lt;LI&gt; &lt;em&gt;Supported&lt;/em&gt; cipher suites:  all the suites which are
      supported by the SSL implementation.  This list is reported
      using {@link #getSupportedCipherSuites}().

      &lt;LI&gt; &lt;em&gt;Enabled&lt;/em&gt; cipher suites, which may be fewer than
      the full set of supported suites.  This group is set using the
      {@link #setEnabledCipherSuites(String [])} method, and
      queried using the {@link #getEnabledCipherSuites}() method.
      Initially, a default set of cipher suites will be enabled on a
      new engine that represents the minimum suggested
      configuration.
 &lt;/UL&gt;

 Implementation defaults require that only cipher suites which
 authenticate servers and provide confidentiality be enabled by
 default.  Only if both sides explicitly agree to unauthenticated
 and/or non-private (unencrypted) communications will such a
 cipher suite be selected.
 &lt;P&gt;
 Each SSL/TLS connection must have one client and one server, thus
 each endpoint must decide which role to assume.  This choice determines
 who begins the handshaking process as well as which type of messages
 should be sent by each party.  The method {@link #setUseClientMode}(boolean) configures the mode.  Once the initial
 handshaking has started, an &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt; can not switch
 between client and server modes, even when performing renegotiations.
 &lt;P&gt;
 Applications might choose to process delegated tasks in different
 threads.  When an &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt;
 is created, the current {@link java.security.AccessControlContext}
 is saved.  All future delegated tasks will be processed using this
 context:  that is, all access control decisions will be made using the
 context captured at engine creation.

 &lt;HR&gt;

 &lt;B&gt;Concurrency Notes&lt;/B&gt;:
 There are two concurrency issues to be aware of:

 &lt;OL&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;wrap()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unwrap()&lt;/code&gt; methods
      may execute concurrently of each other.

      &lt;li&gt; The SSL/TLS protocols employ ordered packets.
      Applications must take care to ensure that generated packets
      are delivered in sequence.  If packets arrive
      out-of-order, unexpected or fatal results may occur.
 &lt;P&gt;
      For example:

      &lt;pre&gt;
              synchronized (outboundLock) {
                  sslEngine.wrap(src, dst);
                  outboundQueue.put(dst);
              }
      &lt;/pre&gt;

      As a corollary, two threads must not attempt to call the same method
      (either &lt;code&gt;wrap()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;unwrap()&lt;/code&gt;) concurrently,
      because there is no way to guarantee the eventual packet ordering.
 &lt;/OL&gt;

 &lt;h3&gt;Default configuration for different Android versions&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;{@code SSLEngine} instances obtained from the default {@link javax.net.ssl.SSLContext} are configured as
 follows:

 &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
   tr.deprecated {
     background-color: #ccc;
     color: #999;
     font-style: italic;

</span> buffers into SSL/TLS network data.  This &lt;i&gt;&quot;gathering&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
 operation encodes, in a single invocation, a sequence of bytes
 from one or more of a given sequence of buffers.  Gathering
 wraps are often useful when implementing network protocols or

 Depending on the state of the SSLEngine, this method may produce
 network data without consuming any application data (for example,
 it may generate handshake data.)
 &lt;P&gt;
 The application is responsible for reliably transporting the
 network data to the peer, and for ensuring that data created by
 multiple calls to wrap() is transported in the same order in which
 it was generated.  The application must properly synchronize
 multiple calls to this method.
 &lt;P&gt;
 If this &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt; has not yet started its initial
 handshake, this method will automatically start the handshake.
 &lt;P&gt;
 This method will attempt to produce SSL/TLS records, and will
 consume as much source data as possible, but will never consume
 more than the sum of the bytes remaining in each buffer.  Each
 &lt;code&gt;ByteBuffer&lt;/code&gt;'s position is updated to reflect the
 amount of data consumed or produced.  The limits remain the
 same.

</span> plaintext application data buffers.  This &lt;i&gt;&quot;scattering&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
 operation decodes, in a single invocation, a sequence of bytes
 into one or more of a given sequence of buffers.  Scattering
 unwraps are often useful when implementing network protocols or
 file formats that, for example, group data into segments
 consisting of one or more fixed-length headers followed by a
 variable-length body.  See

 &lt;P&gt;
 Depending on the state of the SSLEngine, this method may consume
 network data without producing any application data (for example,
 it may consume handshake data.)
 &lt;P&gt;
 The application is responsible for reliably obtaining the network
 data from the peer, and for invoking unwrap() on the data in the
 order it was received.  The application must properly synchronize
 multiple calls to this method.
 &lt;P&gt;
 If this &lt;code&gt;SSLEngine&lt;/code&gt; has not yet started its initial
 handshake, this method will automatically start the handshake.
 &lt;P&gt;
 This method will attempt to consume one complete SSL/TLS network
 packet, but will never consume more than the sum of the bytes
 remaining in the buffers.  Each &lt;code&gt;ByteBuffer&lt;/code&gt;'s
 position is updated to reflect the amount of data consumed or
 produced.  The limits remain the same.

 &lt;code&gt;dsts ByteBuffer&lt;/code&gt;s must not be the same.
 &lt;P&gt;
 The inbound network buffer may be modified as a result of this
 call:  therefore if the network data packet is required for some
 secondary purpose, the data should be duplicated before calling this
 method.  Note:  the network data will not be useful to a second
 SSLEngine, as each SSLEngine contains unique random state which
 influences the SSL/TLS messages.

<span id='javax-net-ssl-SSLEngine-method-setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector'>/**Registers a callback function that selects an application protocol
</span> value for a SSL/TLS handshake.
 The function overrides any values supplied using
 {@link javax.net.ssl.SSLParameters#setApplicationProtocols
 javax.net.ssl.SSLParameters.setApplicationProtocols} and it supports the following
 type parameters:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;dl&gt;
 &lt;dt&gt; {@code SSLEngine}
 &lt;dd&gt; The function's first argument allows the current {@code SSLEngine}
      to be inspected, including the handshake session and configuration
      settings.
 &lt;dt&gt; {@code List&lt;String&gt;}
 &lt;dd&gt; The function's second argument lists the application protocol names
      advertised by the TLS peer.
 &lt;dt&gt; {@code String}
 &lt;dd&gt; The function's result is an application protocol name, or null to
      indicate that none of the advertised names are acceptable.
      If the return value is an empty {@code String} then application
      protocol indications will not be used.
      If the return value is null (no value chosen) or is a value that
      was not advertised by the peer, the underlying protocol will
      determine what action to take. (For example, ALPN will send a
      &quot;no_application_protocol&quot; alert and terminate the connection.)
 &lt;/dl&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 For example, the following call registers a callback function that
 examines the TLS handshake parameters and selects an application protocol
 name:
 &lt;pre&gt;{@code
     serverEngine.setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector(
         (serverEngine, clientProtocols) -&gt; {
             SSLSession session = serverEngine.getHandshakeSession();
             return chooseApplicationProtocol(
                 serverEngine,
                 clientProtocols,
                 session.getProtocol(),
                 session.getCipherSuite());
         });
 }&lt;/pre&gt;

         functionality.
