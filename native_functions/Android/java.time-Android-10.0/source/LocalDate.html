 implements java.io.Serializable

@extends java.lang.Object

 A date without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 such as {@code 2007-12-03}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 {@code LocalDate} is an immutable date-time object that represents a date,
 often viewed as year-month-day. Other date fields, such as day-of-year,
 day-of-week and week-of-year, can also be accessed.
 For example, the value &quot;2nd October 2007&quot; can be stored in a {@code LocalDate}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This class does not store or represent a time or time-zone.
 Instead, it is a description of the date, as used for birthdays.
 It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information
 such as an offset or time-zone.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
 in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
 system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
 For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
 However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them
 to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.

 @implSpec
 This class is immutable and thread-safe.

 A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.

  The date is adjusted to the specified year-based aligned-day-of-week.
  Aligned weeks are counted such that the first week of a given year starts
  on the first day of that year.
  This may cause the date to be moved up to 6 days into the following year.
 &lt;li&gt;{@code DAY_OF_MONTH} -
  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified day-of-month.
  The month and year will be unchanged. If the day-of-month is invalid for the
  year and month, then a {@code DateTimeException} is thrown.
 &lt;li&gt;{@code DAY_OF_YEAR} -
  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified day-of-year.
  The year will be unchanged. If the day-of-year is invalid for the
  year, then a {@code DateTimeException} is thrown.
 &lt;li&gt;{@code EPOCH_DAY} -
  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified epoch-day.
  This completely replaces the date and is equivalent to {@link #ofEpochDay}(long).
 &lt;li&gt;{@code ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH} -
  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified aligned-week-of-month.
  Aligned weeks are counted such that the first week of a given month starts
  on the first day of that month.
  This adjustment moves the date in whole week chunks to match the specified week.
  The result will have the same day-of-week as this date.
  This may cause the date to be moved into the following month.
 &lt;li&gt;{@code ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR} -
  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified aligned-week-of-year.
  Aligned weeks are counted such that the first week of a given year starts
  on the first day of that year.
  This adjustment moves the date in whole week chunks to match the specified week.
  The result will have the same day-of-week as this date.
  This may cause the date to be moved into the following year.
 &lt;li&gt;{@code MONTH_OF_YEAR} -
  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified month-of-year.
  The year will be unchanged. The day-of-month will also be unchanged,
  unless it would be invalid for the new month and year. In that case, the
  day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum valid value for the new month and year.
 &lt;li&gt;{@code PROLEPTIC_MONTH} -
  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified proleptic-month.
  The day-of-month will be unchanged, unless it would be invalid for the new month
  and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum valid value
  for the new month and year.
 &lt;li&gt;{@code YEAR_OF_ERA} -
  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified year-of-era.
  The era and month will be unchanged. The day-of-month will also be unchanged,

 For example, adding one month to 31st January would result in 31st February.

  This is equivalent to {@link #plusDays}(long).
 &lt;li&gt;{@code WEEKS} -
  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified number of weeks added.

 &lt;li&gt;{@code MONTHS} -
  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified number of months added.
  This is equivalent to {@link #plusMonths}(long).
  The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new
  month and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum

 &lt;li&gt;{@code YEARS} -

  The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new

  valid value for the new month and year.
 &lt;li&gt;{@code DECADES} -
  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified number of decades added.
  This is equivalent to calling {@link #plusYears}(long) with the amount
  multiplied by 10.
  The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new
  month and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum
  valid value for the new month and year.
 &lt;li&gt;{@code CENTURIES} -
  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified number of centuries added.
  This is equivalent to calling {@link #plusYears}(long) with the amount
  multiplied by 100.
  The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new
  month and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum
  valid value for the new month and year.
 &lt;li&gt;{@code MILLENNIA} -
  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified number of millennia added.
  This is equivalent to calling {@link #plusYears}(long) with the amount
  multiplied by 1,000.
  The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new
  month and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum
  valid value for the new month and year.
 &lt;li&gt;{@code ERAS} -
  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified number of eras added.
  Only two eras are supported so the amount must be one, zero or minus one.
  If the amount is non-zero then the year is changed such that the year-of-era
  is unchanged.
  The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new
  month and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum
  valid value for the new month and year.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;

 If the field is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
 is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.addTo(Temporal, long)}

 whether and how to perform the addition.
