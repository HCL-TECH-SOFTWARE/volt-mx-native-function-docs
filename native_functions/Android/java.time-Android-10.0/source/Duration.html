</span> implements java.time.temporal.TemporalAmount

 implements java.lang.Comparable

 implements java.io.Serializable

@extends java.lang.Object

 A time-based amount of time, such as '34.5 seconds'.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This class models a quantity or amount of time in terms of seconds and nanoseconds.
 It can be accessed using other duration-based units, such as minutes and hours.
 In addition, the {@link ChronoUnit#DAYS DAYS} unit can be used and is treated as
 exactly equal to 24 hours, thus ignoring daylight savings effects.
 See {@link java.time.Period} for the date-based equivalent to this class.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A physical duration could be of infinite length.
 For practicality, the duration is stored with constraints similar to {@link java.time.Instant}.
 The duration uses nanosecond resolution with a maximum value of the seconds that can
 be held in a {@code long}. This is greater than the current estimated age of the universe.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The range of a duration requires the storage of a number larger than a {@code long}.
 To achieve this, the class stores a {@code long} representing seconds and an {@code int}
 representing nanosecond-of-second, which will always be between 0 and 999,999,999.
 The model is of a directed duration, meaning that the duration may be negative.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The duration is measured in &quot;seconds&quot;, but these are not necessarily identical to
 the scientific &quot;SI second&quot; definition based on atomic clocks.
 This difference only impacts durations measured near a leap-second and should not affect
 most applications.
 See {@link java.time.Instant} for a discussion as to the meaning of the second and time-scales.

 @implSpec
 This class is immutable and thread-safe.

 The string starts with an optional sign, denoted by the ASCII negative
 or positive symbol. If negative, the whole period is negated.
 The ASCII letter &quot;P&quot; is next in upper or lower case.
 There are then four sections, each consisting of a number and a suffix.
 The sections have suffixes in ASCII of &quot;D&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;M&quot; and &quot;S&quot; for
 days, hours, minutes and seconds, accepted in upper or lower case.
 The suffixes must occur in order. The ASCII letter &quot;T&quot; must occur before
 the first occurrence, if any, of an hour, minute or second section.
 At least one of the four sections must be present, and if &quot;T&quot; is present
 there must be at least one section after the &quot;T&quot;.
 The number part of each section must consist of one or more ASCII digits.
 The number may be prefixed by the ASCII negative or positive symbol.
 The number of days, hours and minutes must parse to an {@code long}.
 The number of seconds must parse to an {@code long} with optional fraction.
 The decimal point may be either a dot or a comma.
 The fractional part may have from zero to 9 digits.

 The leading plus/minus sign, and negative values for other units are
 not part of the ISO-8601 standard.
