@extends java.lang.Object

 A time without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 such as {@code 10:15:30}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 {@code LocalTime} is an immutable date-time object that represents a time,
 often viewed as hour-minute-second.
 Time is represented to nanosecond precision.
 For example, the value &quot;13:45.30.123456789&quot; can be stored in a {@code LocalTime}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This class does not store or represent a date or time-zone.
 Instead, it is a description of the local time as seen on a wall clock.
 It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information
 such as an offset or time-zone.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
 in most of the world. This API assumes that all calendar systems use the same
 representation, this class, for time-of-day.

 @implSpec
 This class is immutable and thread-safe.

 This calculates the amount of time between two {@code LocalTime}

 The start and end points are {@code this} and the specified time.
 The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
 The {@code Temporal} passed to this method is converted to a
 {@code LocalTime} using {@link #from}(TemporalAccessor).
 For example, the amount in hours between two times can be calculated
 using {@code startTime.until(endTime, HOURS)}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
 complete units between the two times.
 For example, the amount in hours between 11:30 and 13:29 will only
 be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.
 &lt;p&gt;
 There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
 The first is to invoke this method.
 The second is to use {@link TemporalUnit#between(Temporal, Temporal)}:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   // these two lines are equivalent
   amount = start.until(end, MINUTES);
   amount = MINUTES.between(start, end);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The calculation is implemented in this method for {@link ChronoUnit}.
 The units {@code NANOS}, {@code MICROS}, {@code MILLIS}, {@code SECONDS},
 {@code MINUTES}, {@code HOURS} and {@code HALF_DAYS} are supported.
 Other {@code ChronoUnit} values will throw an exception.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
 is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)}
 passing {@code this} as the first argument and the converted input temporal
 as the second argument.
