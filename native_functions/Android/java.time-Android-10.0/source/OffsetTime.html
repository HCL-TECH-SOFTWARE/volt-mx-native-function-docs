 A time with an offset from UTC/Greenwich in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 such as {@code 10:15:30+01:00}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 {@code OffsetTime} is an immutable date-time object that represents a time, often
 viewed as hour-minute-second-offset.
 This class stores all time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,
 as well as a zone offset.
 For example, the value &quot;13:45.30.123456789+02:00&quot; can be stored
 in an {@code OffsetTime}.

 @implSpec
 This class is immutable and thread-safe.

 The adjustment is equivalent to using {@link Temporal#with(TemporalField, long)}
 twice, passing {@link ChronoField#NANO_OF_DAY} and

<span id='java-time-OffsetTime-method-until'>/**Calculates the amount of time until another time in terms of the specified unit.

 This calculates the amount of time between two {@code OffsetTime}
 objects in terms of a single {@code TemporalUnit}.
 The start and end points are {@code this} and the specified time.
 The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
 For example, the amount in hours between two times can be calculated
 using {@code startTime.until(endTime, HOURS)}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The {@code Temporal} passed to this method is converted to a
 {@code OffsetTime} using {@link #from}(TemporalAccessor).
 If the offset differs between the two times, then the specified
 end time is normalized to have the same offset as this time.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
 complete units between the two times.
 For example, the amount in hours between 11:30Z and 13:29Z will only
 be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.
 &lt;p&gt;
 There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
 The first is to invoke this method.
 The second is to use {@link TemporalUnit#between(Temporal, Temporal)}:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   // these two lines are equivalent
   amount = start.until(end, MINUTES);
   amount = MINUTES.between(start, end);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The calculation is implemented in this method for {@link ChronoUnit}.
 The units {@code NANOS}, {@code MICROS}, {@code MILLIS}, {@code SECONDS},
 {@code MINUTES}, {@code HOURS} and {@code HALF_DAYS} are supported.
 Other {@code ChronoUnit} values will throw an exception.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
 is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)}
 passing {@code this} as the first argument and the converted input temporal
 as the second argument.
