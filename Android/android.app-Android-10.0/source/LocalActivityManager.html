 &lt;p&gt;Helper class for managing multiple running embedded activities in the same
 process. This class is not normally used directly, but rather created for
 you as part of the {@link android.app.ActivityGroup} implementation.

 @see ActivityGroup

 @deprecated Use the new {@link android.app.Fragment} and {@link android.app.FragmentManager} APIs
 instead; these are also
 available on older platforms through the Android compatibility package.

</span> must have a unique string ID associated with it -- this is used to keep
 track of the activity, so that if you later call startActivity() again
 on it the same activity object will be retained.
 
 &lt;p&gt;When there had previously been an activity started under this id,
 it may either be destroyed and a new one started, or the current
 one re-used, based on these conditions, in order:&lt;/p&gt;
 
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; If the Intent maps to a different activity component than is
 currently running, the current activity is finished and a new one
 started.
 &lt;li&gt; If the current activity uses a non-multiple launch mode (such
 as singleTop), or the Intent has the
 {@link Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP} flag set, then the current
 activity will remain running and its
 {@link android.app.Activity#onNewIntent(Intent) android.app.Activity.onNewIntent()} method
 called.
 &lt;li&gt; If the new Intent is the same (excluding extras) as the previous
 one, and the new Intent does not have the
 {@link Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP} set, then the current activity
 will remain running as-is.
 &lt;li&gt; Otherwise, the current activity will be finished and a new
 one started.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 
 &lt;p&gt;If the given Intent can not be resolved to an available Activity,
 this method throws {@link android.content.ActivityNotFoundException}.
 
 &lt;p&gt;Warning: There is an issue where, if the Intent does not
 include an explicit component, we can restore the state for a different
 activity class than was previously running when the state was saved (if
 the set of available activities changes between those points).
