</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Internal utility class to keep track of process-global work that's outstanding and hasn't been
 finished yet.

 New work will be {@link #queue queued}.

 It is possible to add 'finisher'-runnables that are {@link #waitToFinish guaranteed to be run}.
 This is used to make sure the work has been finished.

 This was created for writing SharedPreference edits out asynchronously so we'd have a mechanism
 to wait for the writes in Activity.onPause and similar places, but we may use this mechanism for
 other things in the future.

 The queued asynchronous work is performed on a separate, dedicated thread.

 Used by SharedPreferences$Editor#startCommit().

 Note that this doesn't actually start it running.  This is just a scratch set for callers
 doing async work to keep updated with what's in-flight. In the common case, caller code
 (e.g. SharedPreferences) will pretty quickly call remove() after an add(). The only time
 these Runnables are run is from {@link #waitToFinish}.
