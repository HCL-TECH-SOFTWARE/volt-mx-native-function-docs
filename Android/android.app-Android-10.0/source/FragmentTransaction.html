 The side effect of removing redundant operations is that fragments may have state changes
 out of the expected order. For example, one transaction adds fragment A,

 operations, fragment B could expect that while it is being created, fragment A will also
 exist because fragment A will be removed after fragment B was added.
 With removing redundant operations, fragment B cannot expect fragment A to exist when
 it has been created because fragment A's add/remove will be optimized out.
