</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Provides a single client the ability to use a database.

 &lt;h2&gt;About database sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 Database access is always performed using a session.  The session
 manages the lifecycle of transactions and database connections.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 Sessions can be used to perform both read-only and read-write operations.
 There is some advantage to knowing when a session is being used for
 read-only purposes because the connection pool can optimize the use
 of the available connections to permit multiple read-only operations
 to execute in parallel whereas read-write operations may need to be serialized.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 When &lt;em&gt;Write Ahead Logging (WAL)&lt;/em&gt; is enabled, the database can
 execute simultaneous read-only and read-write transactions, provided that
 at most one read-write transaction is performed at a time.  When WAL is not
 enabled, read-only transactions can execute in parallel but read-write
 transactions are mutually exclusive.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Ownership and concurrency guarantees&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 Session objects are not thread-safe.  In fact, session objects are thread-bound.
 The {@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase} uses a thread-local variable to associate a session
 with each thread for the use of that thread alone.  Consequently, each thread
 has its own session object and therefore its own transaction state independent
 of other threads.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 A thread has at most one session per database.  This constraint ensures that
 a thread can never use more than one database connection at a time for a
 given database.  As the number of available database connections is limited,
 if a single thread tried to acquire multiple connections for the same database
 at the same time, it might deadlock.  Therefore we allow there to be only
 one session (so, at most one connection) per thread per database.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Transactions&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 There are two kinds of transaction: implicit transactions and explicit
 transactions.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 An implicit transaction is created whenever a database operation is requested
 and there is no explicit transaction currently in progress.  An implicit transaction
 only lasts for the duration of the database operation in question and then it
 is ended.  If the database operation was successful, then its changes are committed.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 An explicit transaction is started by calling {@link #beginTransaction} and
 specifying the desired transaction mode.  Once an explicit transaction has begun,
 all subsequent database operations will be performed as part of that transaction.
 To end an explicit transaction, first call {@link #setTransactionSuccessful} if the
 transaction was successful, then call {@link #end}.  If the transaction was
 marked successful, its changes will be committed, otherwise they will be rolled back.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 Explicit transactions can also be nested.  A nested explicit transaction is
 started with {@link #beginTransaction}, marked successful with
 {@link #setTransactionSuccessful}and ended with {@link #endTransaction}.
 If any nested transaction is not marked successful, then the entire transaction
 including all of its nested transactions will be rolled back
 when the outermost transaction is ended.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 To improve concurrency, an explicit transaction can be yielded by calling
 {@link #yieldTransaction}.  If there is contention for use of the database,
 then yielding ends the current transaction, commits its changes, releases the
 database connection for use by another session for a little while, and starts a
 new transaction with the same properties as the original one.
 Changes committed by {@link #yieldTransaction} cannot be rolled back.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 When a transaction is started, the client can provide a {@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteTransactionListener}
 to listen for notifications of transaction-related events.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 Recommended usage:
 &lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
 // First, begin the transaction.
 session.beginTransaction(SQLiteSession.TRANSACTION_MODE_DEFERRED, 0);
 try {
     // Then do stuff...
     session.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO ...&quot;, null, 0);

     // As the very last step before ending the transaction, mark it successful.
     session.setTransactionSuccessful();
 } finally {
     // Finally, end the transaction.
     // This statement will commit the transaction if it was marked successful or
     // roll it back otherwise.
     session.endTransaction();
 }
 &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Database connections&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 A {@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase} can have multiple active sessions at the same
 time.  Each session acquires and releases connections to the database
 as needed to perform each requested database transaction.  If all connections
 are in use, then database transactions on some sessions will block until a
 connection becomes available.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 The session acquires a single database connection only for the duration
 of a single (implicit or explicit) database transaction, then releases it.
 This characteristic allows a small pool of database connections to be shared
 efficiently by multiple sessions as long as they are not all trying to perform
 database transactions at the same time.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Responsiveness&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 Because there are a limited number of database connections and the session holds
 a database connection for the entire duration of a database transaction,
 it is important to keep transactions short.  This is especially important
 for read-write transactions since they may block other transactions
 from executing.  Consider calling {@link #yieldTransaction} periodically
 during long-running transactions.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 Another important consideration is that transactions that take too long to
 run may cause the application UI to become unresponsive.  Even if the transaction
 is executed in a background thread, the user will get bored and
 frustrated if the application shows no data for several seconds while
 a transaction runs.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 Guidelines:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Do not perform database transactions on the UI thread.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Keep database transactions as short as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Simple queries often run faster than complex queries.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Measure the performance of your database transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Consider what will happen when the size of the data set grows.
 A query that works well on 100 rows may struggle with 10,000.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Reentrance&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 This class must tolerate reentrant execution of SQLite operations because
 triggers may call custom SQLite functions that perform additional queries.
 &lt;/p&gt;
