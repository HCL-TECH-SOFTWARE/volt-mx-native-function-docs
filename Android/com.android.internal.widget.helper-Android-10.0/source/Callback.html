</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 This class is the contract between ItemTouchHelper and your application. It lets you control
 which touch behaviors are enabled per each ViewHolder and also receive callbacks when user
 performs these actions.
 &lt;p&gt;
 To control which actions user can take on each view, you should override
 {@link #getMovementFlags(RecyclerView, ViewHolder)} and return appropriate set
 of direction flags. ({@link #LEFT}, {@link #RIGHT}, {@link #START}, {@link #END},
 {@link #UP}, {@link #DOWN}). You can use
 {@link #makeMovementFlags(int, int)} to easily construct it. Alternatively, you can use
 {@link com.android.internal.widget.helper.ItemTouchHelper.SimpleCallback}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If user drags an item, ItemTouchHelper will call
 {@link com.android.internal.widget.helper.ItemTouchHelper.Callback#onMove(RecyclerView, ViewHolder, ViewHolder)
 onMove(recyclerView, dragged, target)}.
 Upon receiving this callback, you should move the item from the old position
 ({@code dragged.getAdapterPosition()}) to new position ({@code target.getAdapterPosition()})
 in your adapter and also call {@link RecyclerView.Adapter#notifyItemMoved(int, int)}.
 To control where a View can be dropped, you can override
 {@link #canDropOver(RecyclerView, ViewHolder, ViewHolder)}. When a
 dragging View overlaps multiple other views, Callback chooses the closest View with which
 dragged View might have changed positions. Although this approach works for many use cases,
 if you have a custom LayoutManager, you can override
 {@link #chooseDropTarget(ViewHolder, java.util.List, int, int)} to select a
 custom drop target.
 &lt;p&gt;
 When a View is swiped, ItemTouchHelper animates it until it goes out of bounds, then calls
 {@link #onSwiped(ViewHolder, int)}. At this point, you should update your
 adapter (e.g. remove the item) and call related Adapter#notify event.

 ItemTouchHelper does not create an extra Bitmap or View while dragging, instead, it
 modifies the existing View. Because of this reason, it is important that the View is
 still part of the layout after it is moved. This may not work as intended when swapped
 Views are close to RecyclerView bounds or there are gaps between them (e.g. other Views
 which were not eligible for dropping over).
 &lt;p&gt;
 This method is responsible to give necessary hint to the LayoutManager so that it will
 keep the View in visible area. For example, for LinearLayoutManager, this is as simple
 as calling {@link LinearLayoutManager#scrollToPositionWithOffset(int, int)}.

 Default implementation calls {@link RecyclerView#scrollToPosition(int)} if the View's
 new position is likely to be out of bounds.
 &lt;p&gt;
 It is important to ensure the ViewHolder will stay visible as otherwise, it might be
 removed by the LayoutManager if the move causes the View to go out of bounds. In that
 case, drag will end prematurely.

<span id='com-android-internal-widget-helper-ItemTouchHelper-Callback-method-interpolateOutOfBoundsScroll'>/**Called by the ItemTouchHelper when user is dragging a view out of bounds.
</span> &lt;p&gt;
 You can override this method to decide how much RecyclerView should scroll in response
 to this action. Default implementation calculates a value based on the amount of View
 out of bounds and the time it spent there. The longer user keeps the View out of bounds,
 the faster the list will scroll. Similarly, the larger portion of the View is out of
 bounds, the faster the RecyclerView will scroll.
@param {Object {RecyclerView}} recyclerView        The RecyclerView instance to which ItemTouchHelper is
                            attached to.
@param {Number} viewSize            The total size of the View in scroll direction, excluding
                            item decorations.
@param {Number} viewSizeOutOfBounds The total size of the View that is out of bounds. This value
                            is negative if the View is dragged towards left or top edge.
@param {Number} totalSize           The total size of RecyclerView in the scroll direction.
@param {Number} msSinceStartScroll  The time passed since View is kept out of bounds.
@return {Number} The amount that RecyclerView should scroll. Keep in mind that this value will
 be passed to {@link RecyclerView#scrollBy(int, int)} method.
