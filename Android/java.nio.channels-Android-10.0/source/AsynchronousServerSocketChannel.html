</span> implements java.nio.channels.AsynchronousChannel

 implements java.nio.channels.NetworkChannel

@extends java.lang.Object

 An asynchronous channel for stream-oriented listening sockets.

 &lt;p&gt; An asynchronous server-socket channel is created by invoking the
 {@link #open open} method of this class.
 A newly-created asynchronous server-socket channel is open but not yet bound.
 It can be bound to a local address and configured to listen for connections
 by invoking the {@link #bind(SocketAddress,int) bind} method. Once bound,
 the {@link #accept(Object,CompletionHandler) accept} method
 is used to initiate the accepting of connections to the channel's socket.
 An attempt to invoke the &lt;tt&gt;accept&lt;/tt&gt; method on an unbound channel will
 cause a {@link java.nio.channels.NotYetBoundException} to be thrown.

 &lt;p&gt; Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads
 though at most one accept operation can be outstanding at any time.
 If a thread initiates an accept operation before a previous accept operation
 has completed then an {@link java.nio.channels.AcceptPendingException} will be thrown.

 &lt;p&gt; Socket options are configured using the {@link #setOption(SocketOption,Object)
 setOption} method. Channels of this type support the following options:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;table border summary=&quot;Socket options&quot;&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;th&gt;Option Name&lt;/th&gt;
     &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF} &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; The size of the socket receive buffer &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR} &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; Re-use address &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.

 &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Usage Example:&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;pre&gt;
  final AsynchronousServerSocketChannel listener =
      AsynchronousServerSocketChannel.open().bind(new InetSocketAddress(5000));

  listener.accept(null, new CompletionHandler&amp;lt;AsynchronousSocketChannel,Void&amp;gt;() {
      public void completed(AsynchronousSocketChannel ch, Void att) {
          // accept the next connection
          listener.accept(null, this);

          // handle this connection
          handle(ch);
      }
      public void failed(Throwable exc, Void att) {
          ...
      }
  });
 &lt;/pre&gt;

</span>
 &lt;p&gt; This method initiates an asynchronous operation to accept a
 connection made to this channel's socket. The {@code handler} parameter is
 a completion handler that is invoked when a connection is accepted (or
 the operation fails). The result passed to the completion handler is
 the {@link java.nio.channels.AsynchronousSocketChannel} to the new connection.

 &lt;p&gt; When a new connection is accepted then the resulting {@code
 AsynchronousSocketChannel} will be bound to the same {@link java.nio.channels.AsynchronousChannelGroup} as this channel. If the group is {@link java.nio.channels.AsynchronousChannelGroup#isShutdown shutdown} and a connection is accepted,
 then the connection is closed, and the operation completes with an {@code
 IOException} and cause {@link java.nio.channels.ShutdownChannelGroupException}.

 &lt;p&gt; To allow for concurrent handling of new connections, the completion
 handler is not invoked directly by the initiating thread when a new
 connection is accepted immediately (see &lt;a
 href=&quot;AsynchronousChannelGroup.html#threading&quot;&gt;Threading&lt;/a&gt;).

 &lt;p&gt; If a security manager has been installed then it verifies that the
 address and port number of the connection's remote endpoint are permitted
 by the security manager's {@link SecurityManager#checkAccept checkAccept}
 method. The permission check is performed with privileges that are restricted
 by the calling context of this method. If the permission check fails then
 the connection is closed and the operation completes with a {@link SecurityException}.
