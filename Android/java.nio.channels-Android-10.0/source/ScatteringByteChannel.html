</span> implements java.nio.channels.ReadableByteChannel

 A channel that can read bytes into a sequence of buffers.

 &lt;p&gt; A &lt;i&gt;scattering&lt;/i&gt; read operation reads, in a single invocation, a
 sequence of bytes into one or more of a given sequence of buffers.
 Scattering reads are often useful when implementing network protocols or
 file formats that, for example, group data into segments consisting of one
 or more fixed-length headers followed by a variable-length body.  Similar
 &lt;i&gt;gathering&lt;/i&gt; write operations are defined in the {@link java.nio.channels.GatheringByteChannel} interface.  &lt;/p&gt;

<span id='java-nio-channels-ScatteringByteChannel-method-read'>/**Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into a subsequence of the
</span> given buffers.

 &lt;p&gt; An invocation of this method attempts to read up to &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; bytes
 from this channel, where &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; is the total number of bytes remaining
 the specified subsequence of the given buffer array, that is,

 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
 dsts[offset].remaining()
     + dsts[offset+1].remaining()
     + ... + dsts[offset+length-1].remaining()&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 at the moment that this method is invoked.

 &lt;p&gt; Suppose that a byte sequence of length &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is read, where
 &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;.
 Up to the first &lt;tt&gt;dsts[offset].remaining()&lt;/tt&gt; bytes of this sequence
 are transferred into buffer &lt;tt&gt;dsts[offset]&lt;/tt&gt;, up to the next
 &lt;tt&gt;dsts[offset+1].remaining()&lt;/tt&gt; bytes are transferred into buffer
 &lt;tt&gt;dsts[offset+1]&lt;/tt&gt;, and so forth, until the entire byte sequence
 is transferred into the given buffers.  As many bytes as possible are
 transferred into each buffer, hence the final position of each updated
 buffer, except the last updated buffer, is guaranteed to be equal to
 that buffer's limit.

 &lt;p&gt; This method may be invoked at any time.  If another thread has
 already initiated a read operation upon this channel, however, then an
 invocation of this method will block until the first operation is
 complete. &lt;/p&gt;
@param {Object {java.nio.ByteBuffer[]}} dsts
         The buffers into which bytes are to be transferred
@param {Number} offset
         The offset within the buffer array of the first buffer into
         which bytes are to be transferred; must be non-negative and no
         larger than &lt;tt&gt;dsts.length&lt;/tt&gt;
@param {Number} length
         The maximum number of buffers to be accessed; must be
