</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 &lt;p&gt;Creates an instance of a hardware-accelerated renderer. This is used to render a scene built
 from {@link android.graphics.RenderNode}'s to an output {@link android.view.Surface}. There can be as many
 HardwareRenderer instances as desired.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3&gt;Resources &amp; lifecycle&lt;/h3&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All HardwareRenderer instances share a common render thread. The render thread contains
 the GPU context &amp; resources necessary to do GPU-accelerated rendering. As such, the first
 HardwareRenderer created comes with the cost of also creating the associated GPU contexts,
 however each incremental HardwareRenderer thereafter is fairly cheap. The expected usage
 is to have a HardwareRenderer instance for every active {@link Surface}. For example
 when an Activity shows a Dialog the system internally will use 2 hardware renderers, both
 of which may be drawing at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;NOTE: Due to the shared, cooperative nature of the render thread it is critical that
 any {@link Surface} used must have a prompt, reliable consuming side. System-provided
 consumers such as {@link android.view.SurfaceView},
 {@link android.view.Window#takeSurface(SurfaceHolder.Callback2)},
 or {@link android.view.TextureView} all fit this requirement. However if custom consumers
 are used such as when using {@link android.graphics.SurfaceTexture} or {@link android.media.ImageReader}
 it is the app's responsibility to ensure that they consume updates promptly and rapidly.
 Failure to do so will cause the render thread to stall on that surface, blocking all
 HardwareRenderer instances.&lt;/p&gt;
