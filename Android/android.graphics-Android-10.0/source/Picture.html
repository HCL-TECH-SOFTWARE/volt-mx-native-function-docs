 A Picture records drawing calls (via the canvas returned by beginRecording)
 and can then play them back into Canvas (via {@link android.graphics.Picture#draw(Canvas)} or
 {@link android.graphics.Canvas#drawPicture(Picture)}).For most content (e.g. text, lines, rectangles),
 drawing a sequence from a picture can be faster than the equivalent API
 calls, since the picture performs its playback without incurring any
 method-call overhead.

 be replayed on a hardware accelerated canvas.&lt;/p&gt;
