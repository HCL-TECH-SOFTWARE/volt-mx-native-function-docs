 &lt;li&gt;A job that is backing up a photo knows the exact size of that
 photo, so it should provide that size as the estimate.
 &lt;li&gt;A job that refreshes top news stories wouldn't know an exact

 when there are new emails with attachments. Jobs that cannot provide
 reasonable estimates should use the sentinel value
