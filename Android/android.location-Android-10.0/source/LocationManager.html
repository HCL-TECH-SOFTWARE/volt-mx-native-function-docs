 &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;requestLocationUpdates()&lt;/code&gt; and
 &lt;code&gt;requestSingleUpdate()&lt;/code&gt; register the current activity to be
 updated periodically by the named provider, or by the provider matching
 the specified {@link android.location.Criteria}, with location and status updates.

 &lt;p&gt; It may take a while to receive the first location update. If
 an immediate location is required, applications may use the
 {@link #getLastKnownLocation}(String) method.

 &lt;p&gt; Location updates are received either by {@link android.location.LocationListener}
 callbacks, or by broadcast intents to a supplied {@link PendingIntent}.

 &lt;p&gt; If the caller supplied a pending intent, then location updates
 are sent with a key of {@link #KEY_LOCATION_CHANGED} and a
 {@link android.location.Location} value.

 &lt;p&gt; The location update interval can be controlled using the minTime parameter.
 The elapsed time between location updates will never be less than
 minTime, although it can be more depending on the Location Provider
 implementation and the update interval requested by other applications.

 &lt;p&gt; Choosing a sensible value for minTime is important to conserve
 battery life. Each location update requires power from
 GPS, WIFI, Cell and other radios. Select a minTime value as high as
 possible while still providing a reasonable user experience.
 If your application is not in the foreground and showing
 location to the user then your application should avoid using an active
 provider (such as {@link #NETWORK_PROVIDER} or {@link #GPS_PROVIDER}),
 but if you insist then select a minTime of 5 * 60 * 1000 (5 minutes)
 or greater. If your application is in the foreground and showing
 location to the user then it is appropriate to select a faster
 update interval.

 &lt;p&gt; The minDistance parameter can also be used to control the
 frequency of location updates. If it is greater than 0 then the
 location provider will only send your application an update when
 the location has changed by at least minDistance meters, AND
 at least minTime milliseconds have passed. However it is more
 difficult for location providers to save power using the minDistance
 parameter, so minTime should be the primary tool to conserving battery
 life.

 &lt;p&gt; If your application wants to passively observe location
 updates triggered by other applications, but not consume
 any additional power otherwise, then use the {@link #PASSIVE_PROVIDER}
 This provider does not actively turn on or modify active location
 providers, so you do not need to be as careful about minTime and
 minDistance. However if your application performs heavy work
 on a location update (such as network activity) then you should
 select non-zero values for minTime and/or minDistance to rate-limit
 your update frequency in the case another application enables a
 location provider with extremely fast updates.

 &lt;p&gt;In case the provider is disabled by the user, updates will stop,
 and a provider availability update will be sent.
 As soon as the provider is enabled again,
 location updates will immediately resume and a provider availability
 update sent. Providers can also send status updates, at any time,
 with extra's specific to the provider. If a callback was supplied
 then status and availability updates are via
 {@link android.location.LocationListener#onProviderDisabled},
 {@link android.location.LocationListener#onProviderEnabled} or
 {@link android.location.LocationListener#onStatusChanged}. Alternately, if a
 pending intent was supplied then status and availability updates
 are broadcast intents with extra keys of
 {@link #KEY_PROVIDER_ENABLED} or {@link #KEY_STATUS_CHANGED}.

 &lt;p&gt; If a {@link android.location.LocationListener} is used but with no Looper specified
 then the calling thread must already
 be a {@link android.os.Looper} thread such as the main thread of the
 calling Activity. If a Looper is specified with a {@link android.location.LocationListener}
 then callbacks are made on the supplied Looper thread.

 &lt;p&gt; When location callbacks are invoked, the system will hold a wakelock
 on your application's behalf for some period of time, but not
 indefinitely. If your application requires a long running wakelock
 within the location callback, you should acquire it yourself.

 &lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt; Prior to Jellybean, the minTime parameter was
 only a hint, and some location provider implementations ignored it.
 From Jellybean and onwards it is mandatory for Android compatible
 devices to observe both the minTime and minDistance parameters.

 locations, or just a single location source, or it may fuse together

 &lt;p&gt;LocationRequest can be null, in which case the system will choose
 default, low power parameters for location updates. You will occasionally
 receive location updates as available, without a major power impact on the
 system. If your application just needs an occasional location update
 without any strict demands, then pass a null LocationRequest.

 &lt;p&gt;Only one LocationRequest can be registered for each unique callback

 &lt;p&gt; If a pending intent is supplied then location updates
 are sent with a key of {@link #KEY_LOCATION_CHANGED} and a

 that no Intent will be fired.  Similarly, an Intent could be
 fired if the device passes very close to the given area but
 does not actually enter it.

 parameter, the location manager will delete this proximity
 alert and no longer monitor it.  A value of -1 indicates that
