@extends java.lang.Object

 This class implements the Operation interface for server side connections.
 &lt;P&gt;
 &lt;STRONG&gt;Request Codes&lt;/STRONG&gt; There are four different request codes that
 are in this class. 0x02 is a PUT request that signals that the request is not
 complete and requires an additional OBEX packet. 0x82 is a PUT request that
 says that request is complete. In this case, the server can begin sending the
 response. The 0x03 is a GET request that signals that the request is not
 finished. When the server receives a 0x83, the client is signaling the server
 that it is done with its request. TODO: Extend the ClientOperation and reuse
 the methods defined TODO: in that class.
