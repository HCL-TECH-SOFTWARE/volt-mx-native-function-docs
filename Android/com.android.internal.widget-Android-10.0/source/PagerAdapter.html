</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Base class providing the adapter to populate pages inside of
 a {@link android.support.v4.view.ViewPager}.  You will most likely want to use a more
 specific implementation of this, such as
 {@link android.support.v4.app.FragmentPagerAdapter} or
 {@link android.support.v4.app.FragmentStatePagerAdapter}.

 &lt;p&gt;When you implement a PagerAdapter, you must override the following methods
 at minimum:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@link #instantiateItem(android.view.ViewGroup, int)}&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@link #destroyItem(android.view.ViewGroup, int, Object)}&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@link #getCount}()&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@link #isViewFromObject(android.view.View, Object)}&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;PagerAdapter is more general than the adapters used for
 {@link android.widget.com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.AdapterView com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.AdapterViews}. Instead of providing a
 View recycling mechanism directly ViewPager uses callbacks to indicate the
 steps taken during an update. A PagerAdapter may implement a form of View
 recycling if desired or use a more sophisticated method of managing page
 Views such as Fragment transactions where each page is represented by its
 own Fragment.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;ViewPager associates each page with a key Object instead of working with
 Views directly. This key is used to track and uniquely identify a given page
 independent of its position in the adapter. A call to the PagerAdapter method
 {@link #startUpdate(android.view.ViewGroup)} indicates that the contents of the ViewPager
 are about to change. One or more calls to {@link #instantiateItem(android.view.ViewGroup, int)}
 and/or {@link #destroyItem(android.view.ViewGroup, int, Object)} will follow, and the end
 of an update will be signaled by a call to {@link #finishUpdate(android.view.ViewGroup)}.
 By the time {@link #finishUpdate(android.view.ViewGroup) finishUpdate} returns the views
 associated with the key objects returned by
 {@link #instantiateItem(android.view.ViewGroup, int) instantiateItem} should be added to
 the parent ViewGroup passed to these methods and the views associated with
 the keys passed to {@link #destroyItem(android.view.ViewGroup, int, Object) destroyItem}
 should be removed. The method {@link #isViewFromObject(android.view.View, Object)} identifies
 whether a page View is associated with a given key object.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A very simple PagerAdapter may choose to use the page Views themselves
 as key objects, returning them from {@link #instantiateItem(android.view.ViewGroup, int)}
 after creation and adding them to the parent ViewGroup. A matching
 {@link #destroyItem(android.view.ViewGroup, int, Object)} implementation would remove the
 View from the parent ViewGroup and {@link #isViewFromObject(android.view.View, Object)}
 could be implemented as &lt;code&gt;return view == object;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;PagerAdapter supports data set changes. Data set changes must occur on the
 main thread and must end with a call to {@link #notifyDataSetChanged}() similar
 to AdapterView adapters derived from {@link android.widget.BaseAdapter}. A data
 set change may involve pages being added, removed, or changing position. The
 ViewPager will keep the current page active provided the adapter implements
 the method {@link #getItemPosition}(Object).&lt;/p&gt;
