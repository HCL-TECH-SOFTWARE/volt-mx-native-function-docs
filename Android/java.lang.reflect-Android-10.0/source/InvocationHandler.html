 the &lt;i&gt;invocation handler&lt;/i&gt; of a proxy instance.

 &lt;p&gt;Each proxy instance has an associated invocation handler.
 When a method is invoked on a proxy instance, the method
 invocation is encoded and dispatched to the {@code invoke}
 method of its invocation handler.

<span id='java-lang-reflect-InvocationHandler-method-invoke'>/**Processes a method invocation on a proxy instance and returns
</span> the result.  This method will be invoked on an invocation handler
 when a method is invoked on a proxy instance that it is
 associated with.
@param {Object {Object}} proxy the proxy instance that the method was invoked on
@param {Object {Method}} method the {@code Method} instance corresponding to
 the interface method invoked on the proxy instance.  The declaring
 class of the {@code Method} object will be the interface that
 the method was declared in, which may be a superinterface of the
 proxy interface that the proxy class inherits the method through.
@param {Object {java.lang.Object[]}} args an array of objects containing the values of the
 arguments passed in the method invocation on the proxy instance,
 or {@code null} if interface method takes no arguments.
 Arguments of primitive types are wrapped in instances of the
 appropriate primitive wrapper class, such as
 {@code java.lang.Integer} or {@code java.lang.Boolean}.
@return {Object {java.lang.Object}} the value to return from the method invocation on the
 proxy instance.  If the declared return type of the interface
 method is a primitive type, then the value returned by
 this method must be an instance of the corresponding primitive
 wrapper class; otherwise, it must be a type assignable to the
 declared return type.  If the value returned by this method is
 {@code null} and the interface method's return type is
 primitive, then a {@code NullPointerException} will be
 thrown by the method invocation on the proxy instance.  If the
 value returned by this method is otherwise not compatible with
 the interface method's declared return type as described above,
 a {@code ClassCastException} will be thrown by the method
 invocation on the proxy instance.
@throws Throwable the exception to throw from the method
 invocation on the proxy instance.  The exception's type must be
 assignable either to any of the exception types declared in the
 {@code throws} clause of the interface method or to the
 unchecked exception types {@code java.lang.RuntimeException}
 or {@code java.lang.Error}.  If a checked exception is
 thrown by this method that is not assignable to any of the
 exception types declared in the {@code throws} clause of
 the interface method, then an
 {@link UndeclaredThrowableException} containing the
 exception that was thrown by this method will be thrown by the
 method invocation on the proxy instance.
