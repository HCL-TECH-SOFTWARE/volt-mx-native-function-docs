 Used to receive callbacks on {@link android.webkit.WebView} renderer events.

 WebViewRenderProcessClient instances may be set or retrieved via {@link android.webkit.WebView#setandroid.webkit.WebViewRenderProcessClient(android.webkit.WebViewRenderProcessClient)} and {@link android.webkit.WebView#getandroid.webkit.WebViewRenderProcessClient()}.

 Instances may be attached to multiple WebViews, and thus a single renderer event may cause
 a callback to be called multiple times with different WebView parameters.

</span> result of a long running blocking task such as the execution of JavaScript.

 &lt;p&gt;If a WebView fails to process an input event, or successfully navigate to a new URL within
 a reasonable time frame, the renderer is considered to be unresponsive, and this callback
 will be called.

 &lt;p&gt;This callback will continue to be called at regular intervals as long as the renderer
 remains unresponsive. If the renderer becomes responsive again, {@link android.webkit.WebViewRenderProcessClient#onRenderProcessResponsive} will be called once, and this method
 will not subsequently be called unless another period of unresponsiveness is detected.

 &lt;p&gt;The minimum interval between successive calls to {@code onRenderProcessUnresponsive} is 5
 seconds.

 &lt;p&gt;No action is taken by WebView as a result of this method call. Applications may
 choose to terminate the associated renderer via the object that is passed to this callback,
 if in multiprocess mode, however this must be accompanied by correctly handling
 {@link android.webkit.WebViewClient#onRenderProcessGone} for this WebView, and all other WebViews associated
 with the same renderer. Failure to do so will result in application termination.
@param {Object {WebView}} view The {@link WebView} for which unresponsiveness was detected.
@param {Object {WebViewRenderProcess}} renderer The {@link WebViewRenderProcess} that has become unresponsive,
 or {@code null} if WebView is running in single process mode.
