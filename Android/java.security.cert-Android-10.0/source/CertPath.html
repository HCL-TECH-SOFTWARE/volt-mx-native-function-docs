</span> implements java.io.Serializable

@extends java.lang.Object

 An immutable sequence of certificates (a certification path).
 &lt;p&gt;
 This is an abstract class that defines the methods common to all
 {@code CertPath}s. Subclasses can handle different kinds of
 certificates (X.509, PGP, etc.).
 &lt;p&gt;
 All {@code CertPath} objects have a type, a list of
 {@code Certificate}s, and one or more supported encodings. Because the
 {@code CertPath} class is immutable, a {@code CertPath} cannot
 change in any externally visible way after being constructed. This
 stipulation applies to all public fields and methods of this class and any
 added or overridden by subclasses.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The type is a {@code String} that identifies the type of
 {@code Certificate}s in the certification path. For each
 certificate {@code cert} in a certification path {@code certPath},
 {@code cert.getType().equals(certPath.getType())} must be
 {@code true}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The list of {@code Certificate}s is an ordered {@code List} of
 zero or more {@code Certificate}s. This {@code List} and all
 of the {@code Certificate}s contained in it must be immutable.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Each {@code CertPath} object must support one or more encodings
 so that the object can be translated into a byte array for storage or
 transmission to other parties. Preferably, these encodings should be
 well-documented standards (such as PKCS#7). One of the encodings supported
 by a {@code CertPath} is considered the default encoding. This
 encoding is used if no encoding is explicitly requested (for the
 {@link #getEncoded() getEncoded()} method, for instance).
 &lt;p&gt;
 All {@code CertPath} objects are also {@code Serializable}.
 {@code CertPath} objects are resolved into an alternate
 {@link java.security.cert.CertPathRep java.security.cert.CertPathRep} object during serialization. This allows
 a {@code CertPath} object to be serialized into an equivalent
 representation regardless of its underlying implementation.
 &lt;p&gt;
 {@code CertPath} objects can be created with a
 {@code CertificateFactory} or they can be returned by other classes,
 such as a {@code CertPathBuilder}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 By convention, X.509 {@code CertPath}s (consisting of
 {@code X509Certificate}s), are ordered starting with the target
 certificate and ending with a certificate issued by the trust anchor. That
 is, the issuer of one certificate is the subject of the following one. The
 certificate representing the {@link java.security.cert.TrustAnchor java.security.cert.TrustAnchor} should not be
 included in the certification path. Unvalidated X.509 {@code CertPath}s
 may not follow these conventions. PKIX {@code CertPathValidator}s will
 detect any departure from these conventions that cause the certification
 path to be invalid and throw a {@code CertPathValidatorException}.

 &lt;p&gt; Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the
 following standard {@code CertPath} encodings:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@code PKCS7}&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@code PkiPath}&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 These encodings are described in the &lt;a href=
 &quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html#CertPathEncodings&quot;&gt;
 CertPath Encodings section&lt;/a&gt; of the
 Java Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation.
 Consult the release documentation for your implementation to see if any
 other encodings are supported.
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Concurrent Access&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 All {@code CertPath} objects must be thread-safe. That is, multiple
 threads may concurrently invoke the methods defined in this class on a
 single {@code CertPath} object (or more than one) with no
 ill effects. This is also true for the {@code List} returned by
 {@code CertPath.getCertificates}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Requiring {@code CertPath} objects to be immutable and thread-safe
 allows them to be passed around to various pieces of code without worrying
 about coordinating access.  Providing this thread-safety is
 generally not difficult, since the {@code CertPath} and
 {@code List} objects in question are immutable.
