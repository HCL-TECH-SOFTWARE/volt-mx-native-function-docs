 A propagation that varies with the distance to the epicenter of the Transition
 or center of the scene if no epicenter exists. When a View is visible in the
 start of the transition, Views farther from the epicenter will transition
 sooner than Views closer to the epicenter. When a View is not in the start
 of the transition or is not visible at the start of the transition, it will
 transition sooner when closer to the epicenter and later when farther from
 the epicenter. This is the default TransitionPropagation used with
 {@link android.transition.Explode}.

 the epicenter and View centered at the epicenter will have a difference
 in start delay of approximately the duration of the Transition. A speed of 2 means the
 start delay difference will be approximately half of the duration of the transition. A
 value of 0 is illegal, but negative values will invert the propagation.
