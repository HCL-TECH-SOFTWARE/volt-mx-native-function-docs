</span> A field of date-time, such as month-of-year or hour-of-minute.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Date and time is expressed using fields which partition the time-line into something
 meaningful for humans. Implementations of this interface represent those fields.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The most commonly used units are defined in {@link java.time.temporal.ChronoField}.
 Further fields are supplied in {@link java.time.temporal.IsoFields}, {@link java.time.temporal.WeekFields} and {@link java.time.temporal.JulianFields}.
 Fields can also be written by application code by implementing this interface.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The field works using double dispatch. Client code calls methods on a date-time like
 {@code LocalDateTime} which check if the field is a {@code ChronoField}.
 If it is, then the date-time must handle it.
 Otherwise, the method call is re-dispatched to the matching method in this interface.

 @implSpec
 This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
 All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 Implementations should be {@code Serializable} where possible.
 An enum is as effective implementation choice.

 For example, in the field 'MonthOfYear', the range is 'Years'.
 See also {@link #getBaseUnit}().

 The range is never null. For example, the 'Year' field is shorthand for
 'YearOfForever'. It therefore has a unit of 'Years' and a range of 'Forever'.

 This method is generally only applicable to the ISO-8601 calendar system.

</span> refine the result.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This uses the temporal object to find the range of valid values for the field.
 This is similar to {@link #range}(), however this method refines the result
 using the temporal. For example, if the field is {@code DAY_OF_MONTH} the
 {@code range} method is not accurate as there are four possible month lengths,
 28, 29, 30 and 31 days. Using this method with a date allows the range to be
 accurate, returning just one of those four options.

 There are two equivalent ways of using this method.

 available in {@link java.time.temporal.ChronoField}.

 This returns a new temporal object based on the specified one with the value for
 this field changed. For example, on a {@code LocalDate}, this could be used to
 set the year, month or day-of-month.
 The returned object has the same observable type as the specified object.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
 a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
 In cases like this, the implementation is responsible for resolving the result.
 Typically it will choose the previous valid date, which would be the last valid
 day of February in this example.
 &lt;p&gt;
 There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
 The first is to invoke this method directly.
 The second is to use {@link java.time.temporal.Temporal#with(java.time.temporal.TemporalField, long)}:

 If the field is not supported an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException} must be thrown.

 Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
