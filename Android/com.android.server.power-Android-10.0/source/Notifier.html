</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Sends broadcasts about important power state changes.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This methods of this class may be called by the power manager service while
 its lock is being held.  Internally it takes care of sending broadcasts to
 notify other components of the system or applications asynchronously.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 The notifier is designed to collapse unnecessary broadcasts when it is not
 possible for the system to have observed an intermediate state.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 For example, if the device wakes up, goes to sleep, wakes up again and goes to
 sleep again before the wake up notification is sent, then the system will
 be told about only one wake up and sleep.  However, we always notify the
 fact that at least one transition occurred.  It is especially important to
 tell the system when we go to sleep so that it can lock the keyguard if needed.
 &lt;/p&gt;
