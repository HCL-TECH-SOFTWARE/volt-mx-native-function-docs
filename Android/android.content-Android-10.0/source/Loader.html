</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 A class that performs asynchronous loading of data. While Loaders are active
 they should monitor the source of their data and deliver new results when the contents
 change.  See {@link android.app.LoaderManager} for more detail.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note on threading:&lt;/b&gt; Clients of loaders should as a rule perform
 any calls on to a Loader from the main thread of their process (that is,
 the thread the Activity callbacks and other things occur on).  Subclasses
 of Loader (such as {@link android.content.AsyncTaskLoader}) will often perform their work
 in a separate thread, but when delivering their results this too should
 be done on the main thread.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Subclasses generally must implement at least {@link #onStartLoading}(),
 {@link #onStopLoading}(), {@link #onForceLoad}(), and {@link #onReset}().&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Most implementations should not derive directly from this class, but
 instead inherit from {@link android.content.AsyncTaskLoader}.&lt;/p&gt;

 Starts an asynchronous load of the Loader's data. When the result

 will be cleared.  If another load request comes in during this time,
 it will be held until the canceled load is complete.
