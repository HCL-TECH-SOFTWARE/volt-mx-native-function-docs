 &lt;p&gt;
 This is like {@link #getFilesDir}() in that these files will be deleted
 when the application is uninstalled, however there are some important
 differences:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Shared storage may not always be available, since removable media can
 be ejected by the user. Media state can be checked using
 {@link Environment#getExternalStorageState(File)}.
 &lt;li&gt;There is no security enforced with these files. For example, any

 these files.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 If a shared storage device is emulated (as determined by
 {@link Environment#isExternalStorageEmulated(File)}), it's contents are
 backed by a private user data partition, which means there is little
 benefit to storing data here instead of the private directories returned
 by {@link #getFilesDir}(), etc.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Starting in {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#KITKAT}, no permissions
 are required to read or write to the returned path; it's always
 accessible to the calling app. This only applies to paths generated for
 package name of the calling application. To access paths belonging to
 other packages,
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} and/or
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} are required.
 &lt;p&gt;
 On devices with multiple users (as described by {@link UserManager}),
 each user has their own isolated shared storage. Applications only have
 access to the shared storage for the user they're running as.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The returned path may change over time if different shared storage media
 is inserted, so only relative paths should be persisted.

 If you supply a non-null &lt;var&gt;type&lt;/var&gt; to this function, the returned
 file will be a path to a sub-directory of the given type. Though these
 files are not automatically scanned by the media scanner, you can
 explicitly add them to the media database with

 MediaScannerConnection.scanFile}. Note that this is not the same as
 {@link android.os.Environment#getExternalStoragePublicDirectory

 directories of media shared by all applications. The directories returned
 here are owned by the application, and their contents will be removed

 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Shared storage may not always be available, since removable media can

 Starting in {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#KITKAT}, no permissions
 are required to read or write to the path that this method returns.
 However, starting from {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M},
 to read the OBB expansion files, you must declare the
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} permission in the app manifest and ask for
 permission at runtime as follows:
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 {@code &lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE&quot;
 android:maxSdkVersion=&quot;23&quot; /&gt;}
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 Starting from {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#N},
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE}
 permission is not required, so don’t ask for this
 permission at runtime. To handle both cases, your app must first try to read the OBB file,
 and if it fails, you must request
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} permission at runtime.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 The following code snippet shows how to do this:
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;pre&gt;
 File obb = new File(obb_filename);
 boolean open_failed = false;

 try {
     BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(obb));

 if (open_failed) {
     // request READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission before reading OBB file
     ReadObbFileWithPermission();
 }

 &lt;p&gt;The system may broadcast Intents that are &quot;sticky&quot; -- these stay
 around after the broadcast has finished, to be sent to any later
 registrations. If your IntentFilter matches one of these sticky
 Intents, that Intent will be returned by this function

 been broadcast.

 this case, only one of these can be returned directly by the function;
 which of these that is returned is arbitrarily decided by the system.

 &lt;p&gt;If you know the Intent your are registering for is sticky, you can

 do not nest: no matter how many times you call startService(),
 a single call to {@link #stopService} will stop it.

 possible.  The only time they should be stopped is if the current

 to be killed.  If any errors happen in the service's process, it will
 automatically be restarted.
