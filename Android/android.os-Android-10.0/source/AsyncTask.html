</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 &lt;p&gt;AsyncTask enables proper and easy use of the UI thread. This class allows you
 to perform background operations and publish results on the UI thread without
 having to manipulate threads and/or handlers.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;AsyncTask is designed to be a helper class around {@link Thread} and {@link android.os.Handler}
 and does not constitute a generic threading framework. AsyncTasks should ideally be
 used for short operations (a few seconds at the most.) If you need to keep threads
 running for long periods of time, it is highly recommended you use the various APIs
 provided by the &lt;code&gt;java.util.concurrent&lt;/code&gt; package such as {@link Executor},
 {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} and {@link FutureTask}.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;An asynchronous task is defined by a computation that runs on a background thread and
 whose result is published on the UI thread. An asynchronous task is defined by 3 generic
 types, called &lt;code&gt;Params&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Progress&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt;,
 and 4 steps, called &lt;code&gt;onPreExecute&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;doInBackground&lt;/code&gt;,
 &lt;code&gt;onProgressUpdate&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;onPostExecute&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;div class=&quot;special reference&quot;&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Developer Guides&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;For more information about using tasks and threads, read the
 &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}guide/components/processes-and-threads.html&quot;&gt;Processes and
 Threads&lt;/a&gt; developer guide.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;AsyncTask must be subclassed to be used. The subclass will override at least
 one method ({@link #doInBackground}), and most often will override a
 second one ({@link #onPostExecute}.)&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Here is an example of subclassing:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
 private class DownloadFilesTask extends AsyncTask&amp;lt;URL, Integer, Long&amp;gt; {
     protected Long doInBackground(URL... urls) {
         int count = urls.length;
         long totalSize = 0;
         for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; count; i++) {
             totalSize += Downloader.downloadFile(urls[i]);
             publishProgress((int) ((i / (float) count) * 100));
             // Escape early if cancel() is called
             if (isCancelled()) break;
         }
         return totalSize;
     }

     protected void onProgressUpdate(Integer... progress) {
         setProgressPercent(progress[0]);
     }

     protected void onPostExecute(Long result) {
         showDialog(&quot;Downloaded &quot; + result + &quot; bytes&quot;);
     }
 }
 &lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Once created, a task is executed very simply:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
 new DownloadFilesTask().execute(url1, url2, url3);
 &lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;AsyncTask's generic types&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The three types used by an asynchronous task are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;ol&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Params&lt;/code&gt;, the type of the parameters sent to the task upon
     execution.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Progress&lt;/code&gt;, the type of the progress units published during
     the background computation.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt;, the type of the result of the background
     computation.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Not all types are always used by an asynchronous task. To mark a type as unused,
 simply use the type {@link Void}:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;pre&gt;
 private class MyTask extends AsyncTask&amp;lt;Void, Void, Void&amp;gt; { ... }
 &lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The 4 steps&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;When an asynchronous task is executed, the task goes through 4 steps:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;ol&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;{@link #onPreExecute}(), invoked on the UI thread before the task
     is executed. This step is normally used to setup the task, for instance by
     showing a progress bar in the user interface.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;{@link #doInBackground}, invoked on the background thread
     immediately after {@link #onPreExecute}() finishes executing. This step is used
     to perform background computation that can take a long time. The parameters
     of the asynchronous task are passed to this step. The result of the computation must
     be returned by this step and will be passed back to the last step. This step
     can also use {@link #publishProgress} to publish one or more units
     of progress. These values are published on the UI thread, in the
     {@link #onProgressUpdate} step.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;{@link #onProgressUpdate}, invoked on the UI thread after a
     call to {@link #publishProgress}. The timing of the execution is
     undefined. This method is used to display any form of progress in the user
     interface while the background computation is still executing. For instance,
     it can be used to animate a progress bar or show logs in a text field.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;{@link #onPostExecute}, invoked on the UI thread after the background
     computation finishes. The result of the background computation is passed to
     this step as a parameter.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
 
 &lt;h2&gt;Cancelling a task&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A task can be cancelled at any time by invoking {@link #cancel}(boolean). Invoking
 this method will cause subsequent calls to {@link #isCancelled}() to return true.
 After invoking this method, {@link #onCancelled}(Object), instead of
 {@link #onPostExecute}(Object) will be invoked after {@link #doInBackground(Object[])}
 returns. To ensure that a task is cancelled as quickly as possible, you should always
 check the return value of {@link #isCancelled}() periodically from
 {@link #doInBackground(Object[])}, if possible (inside a loop for instance.)&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Threading rules&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;There are a few threading rules that must be followed for this class to
 work properly:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;The AsyncTask class must be loaded on the UI thread. This is done
     automatically as of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#JELLY_BEAN}.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;The task instance must be created on the UI thread.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;{@link #execute} must be invoked on the UI thread.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Do not call {@link #onPreExecute}(), {@link #onPostExecute},
     {@link #doInBackground}, {@link #onProgressUpdate} manually.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;The task can be executed only once (an exception will be thrown if
     a second execution is attempted.)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Memory observability&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;AsyncTask guarantees that all callback calls are synchronized to ensure the following
 without explicit synchronizations.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;The memory effects of {@link #onPreExecute}, and anything else
     executed before the call to {@link #execute}, including the construction
     of the AsyncTask object, are visible to {@link #doInBackground}.
     &lt;li&gt;The memory effects of {@link #doInBackground} are visible to
     {@link #onPostExecute}.
     &lt;li&gt;Any memory effects of {@link #doInBackground} preceding a call
     to {@link #publishProgress} are visible to the corresponding
     {@link #onProgressUpdate} call. (But {@link #doInBackground} continues to
     run, and care needs to be taken that later updates in {@link #doInBackground}
     do not interfere with an in-progress {@link #onProgressUpdate} call.)
     &lt;li&gt;Any memory effects preceding a call to {@link #cancel} are visible
     after a call to {@link #isCancelled} that returns true as a result, or
     during and after a resulting call to {@link #onCancelled}.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Order of execution&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;When first introduced, AsyncTasks were executed serially on a single background
 thread. Starting with {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#DONUT}, this was changed
 to a pool of threads allowing multiple tasks to operate in parallel. Starting with
 {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#HONEYCOMB}, tasks are executed on a single
 thread to avoid common application errors caused by parallel execution.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;If you truly want parallel execution, you can invoke
 {@link #executeOnExecutor(java.util.concurrent.Executor, Object[])} with
 {@link #THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR}.&lt;/p&gt;
