</span> implements android.os.IBinder

@extends java.lang.Object

 Base class for a remotable object, the core part of a lightweight
 remote procedure call mechanism defined by {@link android.os.IBinder}.
 This class is an implementation of IBinder that provides
 standard local implementation of such an object.

 &lt;p&gt;Most developers will not implement this class directly, instead using the
 &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}guide/components/aidl.html&quot;&gt;aidl&lt;/a&gt; tool to describe the desired
 interface, having it generate the appropriate Binder subclass.  You can,
 however, derive directly from Binder to implement your own custom RPC
 protocol or simply instantiate a raw Binder object directly to use as a
 token that can be shared across processes.

 &lt;p&gt;This class is just a basic IPC primitive; it has no impact on an application's
 lifecycle, and is valid only as long as the process that created it continues to run.
 To use this correctly, you must be doing so within the context of a top-level
 application component (a {@link android.app.Service}, {@link android.app.Activity},
 or {@link android.content.ContentProvider}) that lets the system know your process
 should remain running.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;You must keep in mind the situations in which your process
 could go away, and thus require that you later re-create a new Binder and re-attach
 it when the process starts again.  For example, if you are using this within an
 {@link android.app.Activity}, your activity's process may be killed any time the
 activity is not started; if the activity is later re-created you will need to
 create a new Binder and hand it back to the correct place again; you need to be
 aware that your process may be started for another reason (for example to receive
 a broadcast) that will not involve re-creating the activity and thus run its code
 to create a new Binder.&lt;/p&gt;
