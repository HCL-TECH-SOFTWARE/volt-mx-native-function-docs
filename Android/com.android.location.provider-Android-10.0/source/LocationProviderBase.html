</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Base class for location providers implemented as unbundled services.

 &lt;p&gt;The network location provider must export a service with action
 &quot;com.android.location.service.v2.NetworkLocationProvider&quot;
 and a valid minor version in a meta-data field on the service, and
 then return the result of {@link #getBinder}() on service binding.

 &lt;p&gt;The fused location provider must export a service with action
 &quot;com.android.location.service.FusedLocationProvider&quot;
 and a valid minor version in a meta-data field on the service, and
 then return the result of {@link #getBinder}() on service binding.

 &lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT: This class is effectively a public API for unbundled
 applications, and must remain API stable. See README.txt in the root
 of this package for more information.

 Manager that this provider will generally be unable to fulfill incoming requests. This

 whether to attempt to satisfy those requests or not.

 Some guidelines: providers should set their own enabled/disabled status based only on state
 &quot;owned&quot; by that provider. For instance, providers should not take into account the state of
 the location master setting when setting themselves enabled or disabled, as this state is not
 owned by a particular provider. If a provider requires some additional user consent that is
 particular to the provider, this should be use to set the enabled/disabled state. If the
 provider proxies to another provider, the child provider's enabled/disabled state should be
 taken into account in the parent's enabled/disabled state. For most providers, it is expected
 that they will be always enabled.
