 This class contains methods for managing IPsec sessions. Once configured, the kernel will apply
 confidentiality (encryption) and integrity (authentication) to IP traffic.

 &lt;p&gt;Note that not all aspects of IPsec are permitted by this API. Applications may create
 transport mode security associations and apply them to individual sockets. Applications looking
 to create a VPN should use {@link android.net.VpnService}.

</span>
 &lt;p&gt;This applies transport mode encapsulation to the given socket. Once applied, I/O on the
 socket will be encapsulated according to the parameters of the {@code IpSecTransform}. When
 the transform is removed from the socket by calling {@link #removeTransportModeTransforms},
 unprotected traffic can resume on that socket.

 &lt;p&gt;For security reasons, the destination address of any traffic on the socket must match the
 remote {@code InetAddress} of the {@code IpSecTransform}. Attempts to send traffic to any
 other IP address will result in an IOException. In addition, reads and writes on the socket
 will throw IOException if the user deactivates the transform (by calling {@link android.net.IpSecTransform#close()}) without calling {@link #removeTransportModeTransforms}.

 &lt;p&gt;Note that when applied to TCP sockets, calling {@link android.net.IpSecTransform#close()} on an
 applied transform before completion of graceful shutdown may result in the shutdown sequence
 failing to complete. As such, applications requiring graceful shutdown MUST close the socket
 prior to deactivating the applied transform. Socket closure may be performed asynchronously
 (in batches), so the returning of a close function does not guarantee shutdown of a socket.
 Setting an SO_LINGER timeout results in socket closure being performed synchronously, and is
 sufficient to ensure shutdown.

 Specifically, if the transform is deactivated (by calling {@link android.net.IpSecTransform#close()}),
 prior to the socket being closed, the standard [FIN - FIN/ACK - ACK], or the reset [RST]
 packets are dropped due to the lack of a valid Transform. Similarly, if a socket without the
 SO_LINGER option set is closed, the delayed/batched FIN packets may be dropped.

 &lt;h4&gt;Rekey Procedure&lt;/h4&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;When applying a new tranform to a socket in the outbound direction, the previous transform
 will be removed and the new transform will take effect immediately, sending all traffic on
 the new transform; however, when applying a transform in the inbound direction, traffic
 on the old transform will continue to be decrypted and delivered until that transform is
 deallocated by calling {@link android.net.IpSecTransform#close()}. This overlap allows lossless rekey
 procedures where both transforms are valid until both endpoints are using the new transform
 and all in-flight packets have been received.
