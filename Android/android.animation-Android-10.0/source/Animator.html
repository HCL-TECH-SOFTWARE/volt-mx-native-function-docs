 that it must run the animation on the UI thread anyway.

 listener callbacks will be called on the UI thread.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The animator is immutable while {@link #isStarted}() is true. Requests
    to change duration, delay, etc... may be ignored.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Lifecycle callback events may be asynchronous. Events such as
    {@link android.animation.Animator.android.animation.AnimatorListener#onAnimationEnd(android.animation.Animator)} or
    {@link android.animation.Animator.android.animation.AnimatorListener#onAnimationRepeat(android.animation.Animator)} may end up delayed
    as they must be posted back to the UI thread, and any actions performed
    by those callbacks (such as starting new animations) will not happen
    in the same frame.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;State change requests ({@link #cancel}(), {@link #end}(), {@link #reverse}(), etc...)
    may be asynchronous. It is guaranteed that all state changes that are
    performed on the UI thread in the same frame will be applied as a single
    atomic update, however that frame may be the current frame,
    the next frame, or some future frame. This will also impact the observed
    state of the Animator. For example, {@link #isStarted}() may still return true
    after a call to {@link #end}(). Using the lifecycle callbacks is preferred over
    queries to {@link #isStarted}(), {@link #isRunning}(), and {@link #isPaused}()
