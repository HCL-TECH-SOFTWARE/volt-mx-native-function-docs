</span> implements android.animation.AnimationHandler.AnimationFrameCallback

@extends android.animation.Animator

 This class provides a simple timing engine for running animations
 which calculate animated values and set them on target objects.

 &lt;p&gt;There is a single timing pulse that all animations use. It runs in a
 custom handler to ensure that property changes happen on the UI thread.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;By default, ValueAnimator uses non-linear time interpolation, via the
 {@link AccelerateDecelerateInterpolator} class, which accelerates into and decelerates
 out of an animation. This behavior can be changed by calling
 {@link android.animation.ValueAnimator#setInterpolator(TimeInterpolator)}.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Animators can be created from either code or resource files. Here is an example
 of a ValueAnimator resource file:&lt;/p&gt;

 {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/res/anim/animator.xml ValueAnimatorResources}

 &lt;p&gt;Starting from API 23, it is also possible to use a combination of {@link android.animation.PropertyValuesHolder.PropertyValuesHolder}
 and {@link android.animation.Keyframe} resource tags to create a multi-step animation.
 Note that you can specify explicit fractional values (from 0 to 1) for
 each keyframe to determine when, in the overall duration, the animation should arrive at that
 value. Alternatively, you can leave the fractions off and the keyframes will be equally
 distributed within the total duration:&lt;/p&gt;

 {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/res/anim/value_animator_pvh_kf.xml
 ValueAnimatorKeyframeResources}
