</span> implements java.io.Closeable

@extends java.net.ResponseCache

 Caches HTTP and HTTPS responses to the filesystem so they may be reused,
 saving time and bandwidth. This class supports {@link java.net.HttpURLConnection} and {@link javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection};
 there is no platform-provided cache for {@code DefaultHttpClient} or
 {@code AndroidHttpClient}. Installation and instances are thread
 safe.

 &lt;h3&gt;Installing an HTTP response cache&lt;/h3&gt;
 Enable caching of all of your application's HTTP requests by installing the
 cache at application startup. For example, this code installs a 10 MiB cache
 in the {@link android.content.Context#getCacheDir() application-specific
 cache directory} of the filesystem}: &lt;pre&gt;   {@code
   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       ...

       try {
           File httpCacheDir = new File(context.getCacheDir(), &quot;http&quot;);
           long httpCacheSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10 MiB
           HttpResponseCache.install(httpCacheDir, httpCacheSize);
       } catch (IOException e) {
           Log.i(TAG, &quot;HTTP response cache installation failed:&quot; + e);
       }
   }

   protected void onStop() {
       ...

       HttpResponseCache cache = HttpResponseCache.getInstalled();
       if (cache != null) {
           cache.flush();
       }
   }}&lt;/pre&gt;
 This cache will evict entries as necessary to keep its size from exceeding
 10 MiB. The best cache size is application specific and depends on the size
 and frequency of the files being downloaded. Increasing the limit may improve
 the hit rate, but it may also just waste filesystem space!

 &lt;p&gt;For some applications it may be preferable to create the cache in the
 external storage directory. &lt;strong&gt;There are no access controls on the
 external storage directory so it should not be used for caches that could
 contain private data.&lt;/strong&gt; Although it often has more free space,
 external storage is optional and&amp;#8212;even if available&amp;#8212;can disappear
 during use. Retrieve the external cache directory using {@link android.content.Context#getExternalCacheDir()}. If this method returns null,
 your application should fall back to either not caching or caching on
 non-external storage. If the external storage is removed during use, the
 cache hit rate will drop to zero and ongoing cache reads will fail.

 &lt;p&gt;Flushing the cache forces its data to the filesystem. This ensures that
 all responses written to the cache will be readable the next time the
 activity starts.

 &lt;h3&gt;Cache Optimization&lt;/h3&gt;
 To measure cache effectiveness, this class tracks three statistics:
 &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;{@link #getRequestCount() Request Count:}&lt;/strong&gt; the number
         of HTTP requests issued since this cache was created.
     &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;{@link #getNetworkCount() Network Count:}&lt;/strong&gt; the
         number of those requests that required network use.
     &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;{@link #getHitCount() Hit Count:}&lt;/strong&gt; the number of
         those requests whose responses were served by the cache.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 Sometimes a request will result in a conditional cache hit. If the cache
 contains a stale copy of the response, the client will issue a conditional
 {@code GET}. The server will then send either the updated response if it has
 changed, or a short 'not modified' response if the client's copy is still
 valid. Such responses increment both the network count and hit count.

 &lt;p&gt;The best way to improve the cache hit rate is by configuring the web
 server to return cacheable responses. Although this client honors all &lt;a
 href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt&quot;&gt;HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2068)&lt;/a&gt; cache
 headers, it doesn't cache partial responses.

 &lt;h3&gt;Force a Network Response&lt;/h3&gt;
 In some situations, such as after a user clicks a 'refresh' button, it may be
 necessary to skip the cache, and fetch data directly from the server. To force
 a full refresh, add the {@code no-cache} directive: &lt;pre&gt;   {@code
         connection.addRequestProperty(&quot;Cache-Control&quot;, &quot;no-cache&quot;);
 }&lt;/pre&gt;
 If it is only necessary to force a cached response to be validated by the
 server, use the more efficient {@code max-age=0} instead: &lt;pre&gt;   {@code
         connection.addRequestProperty(&quot;Cache-Control&quot;, &quot;max-age=0&quot;);
 }&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;h3&gt;Force a Cache Response&lt;/h3&gt;
 Sometimes you'll want to show resources if they are available immediately,
 but not otherwise. This can be used so your application can show
 &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; while waiting for the latest data to be downloaded. To
 restrict a request to locally-cached resources, add the {@code
 only-if-cached} directive: &lt;pre&gt;   {@code
     try {
         connection.addRequestProperty(&quot;Cache-Control&quot;, &quot;only-if-cached&quot;);
         InputStream cached = connection.getInputStream();
         // the resource was cached! show it
     } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
         // the resource was not cached
     }
 }&lt;/pre&gt;
 This technique works even better in situations where a stale response is
 better than no response. To permit stale cached responses, use the {@code
 max-stale} directive with the maximum staleness in seconds: &lt;pre&gt;   {@code
         int maxStale = 60 * 60 * 24 * 28; // tolerate 4-weeks stale
         connection.addRequestProperty(&quot;Cache-Control&quot;, &quot;max-stale=&quot; + maxStale);
 }&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;h3&gt;Working With Earlier Releases&lt;/h3&gt;
 This class was added in Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich). Use reflection to
 enable the response cache without impacting earlier releases: &lt;pre&gt;   {@code
       try {
           File httpCacheDir = new File(context.getCacheDir(), &quot;http&quot;);
           long httpCacheSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10 MiB
           Class.forName(&quot;android.net.http.HttpResponseCache&quot;)
                   .getMethod(&quot;install&quot;, File.class, long.class)
                   .invoke(null, httpCacheDir, httpCacheSize);
       } catch (Exception httpResponseCacheNotAvailable) {
       }}&lt;/pre&gt;
