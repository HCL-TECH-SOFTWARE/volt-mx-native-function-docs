</span>  MatchFilter enables client code to have more control over
  what is allowed to match and become a link, and what is not.

  For example:  when matching web URLs you would like things like
  http://www.example.com to match, as well as just example.com itelf.
  However, you would not want to match against the domain in
  support@example.com.  So, when matching against a web URL pattern you
  might also include a MatchFilter that disallows the match if it is
  immediately preceded by an at-sign (@).
