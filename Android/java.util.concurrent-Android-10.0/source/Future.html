</span> A {@code Future} represents the result of an asynchronous
 computation.  Methods are provided to check if the computation is
 complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of
 the computation.  The result can only be retrieved using method
 {@code get} when the computation has completed, blocking if
 necessary until it is ready.  Cancellation is performed by the
 {@code cancel} method.  Additional methods are provided to
 determine if the task completed normally or was cancelled. Once a
 computation has completed, the computation cannot be cancelled.
 If you would like to use a {@code Future} for the sake
 of cancellability but not provide a usable result, you can
 declare types of the form {@code Future&lt;?&gt;} and
 return {@code null} as a result of the underlying task.

 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Sample Usage&lt;/b&gt; (Note that the following classes are all
 made-up.)

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 interface ArchiveSearcher { String search(String target); }
 class App {
   ExecutorService executor = ...
   ArchiveSearcher searcher = ...
   void showSearch(final String target)
       throws InterruptedException {
     Future&lt;String&gt; future
       = executor.submit(new Callable&lt;String&gt;() {
         public String call() {
             return searcher.search(target);
         }});
     displayOtherThings(); // do other things while searching
     try {
       displayText(future.get()); // use future
     } catch (ExecutionException ex) { cleanup(); return; }
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 The {@link java.util.concurrent.FutureTask} class is an implementation of {@code Future} that
 implements {@code Runnable}, and so may be executed by an {@code Executor}.
 For example, the above construction with {@code submit} could be replaced by:
 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 FutureTask&lt;String&gt; future =
   new FutureTask&lt;&gt;(new Callable&lt;String&gt;() {
     public String call() {
       return searcher.search(target);
   }});
 executor.execute(future);}&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Memory consistency effects: Actions taken by the asynchronous computation
 &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility&quot;&gt; &lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 actions following the corresponding {@code Future.get()} in another thread.
